                                <h2>The Week of 11/1</h2>
                                <div className="byline">By Joey Zelinka October 31, 2021</div>
                                <p>We have officially come out of beta and worldofrealms.com has officially launched! I’ve finally been able to look up from the code (yes, I coded this entire site from a blank compiler) long enough to see that WE HAVE A SITE! The three open Realms are steadily pumping out content and everything is moving along nicely. A quick recap of some happenings from around the multiverse…Crimson Vow spoilers have hit (I’m loving yet ANOTHER Thalia reprint)! ITC So Cal results have caused rumblings for an irrational banning in Warhammer 40,000.</p>
                                <p>I’ll be writing a primer for Mono-White Aggro in Standard. The least oppressive deck that everyone on Facebook likes to complain about. If all goes to plan, I have a special guest writer (a well-known member of the Atlanta Magic community) coming on to talk about some Crimson Vow draft strategy. Stay tuned.</p>
                                <p>Tyler will be bringing “Faction Introduction: Imperial Guard” to Bellz of War in the 40k Realm this week. You can rest assured knowing that by the end of his thorough introduction, you will know all the things Imperial Guard. This will kick off a series introducing all factions one by one. Tyler is insisting on starting with the Imperium but, whatever XENOS FOREVER!</p>
                                <p>Ooooooohhhhh the RPG Realm has me most excited this week. The beloved Mr. L has submitted his first blog post for World of Realms! Mr. L is a dedicated gamer with decades of DM experience. He’s written a masterpiece detailing how he prepares for an RPG campaign. Ryan is bringing a couple opinion pieces this week. He’s going to delve into the recent D&D/Magic: the Gathering crossover as well as the move Pathfinder has made to launch its own version of D&D Beyond.</p>
                                <p>The plan is to keep it coming! Let us know if there is something you would like to see!</p>
                                <p>So, check back often and stay awhile…</p>

                                <p>Blog number two. We’re off and running. We’ve added more content creators to the roster, and we are opening another Realm this coming week. Exciting stuff so let’s get into it.</p>
                                <p>“Poetically Aggro” will be bringing a little satire this week. I’ve been working on a fun piece that I hope to turn into a regular series on this blog called “What Your Choice of Board Wipe Says About You”. For the first blog in the series, I will be covering sweepers that have the text “Destroy all…” and what your choice says about you.</p>
                                <p>Starting today, the Warhammer 40,000 Realm is officially open! Tyler Leavitt has signed on to be Head of Content in our 40k Realm. He figured a good intro would be TO DO an intro to the wonderful world of Warhammer 40,000. His thorough analysis and suggestions will save you time and money. So, if you finally want to take the plunge into this grim future, Tyler’s hard work will protect your two most valuable resources.</p>
                                <p>We’ve got a few articles coming this week in the RPG Realm. Ryan will be talking about a Pirate based D&D one shot he developed, a Commander Farsight to D&D conversion and another Spooky Saturday with our special guest Michael Myers. Tyler has also been working on some RPG content for us in addition to his 40k work load. Look for his introduction to the Pokemon RPG!</p>
                                <p>We’re really excited about where we’re headed. Along with creating content we’ll all be gaming hard this week. I’ll be grinding Arena before the season ends, Ryan is running D&D 5e somewhere AT ALL TIMES and our adventurers will be reconvening this coming Sunday for some 2nd Edition shenanigans. So, check back often and stay awhile….</p>

                                <p>We created World of Realms to serve gamers. Our mission is to provide fellow nerds with the things they want, and that is how we’ve run the business from the start. From our card
                                    prices to the content we have created thus far, World of Realms is here for you.</p>
                                <p>With that  goal in mind, the natural step was to launch a website to
                                    fill with content. We’re going to bring you original content based on games that WE ACTUALLY
                                    play. There is a team of bloggers that will be working  tirelessly throughout the week. In addition to our original content, we are going to be filter out
                                    all the garbage out there, and bring you only the news you need.. If we share an article from another site, we stand by it. It means the
                                    information in the article is valid and relevant. No clickbait, no “This is what Richard Garfield
                                    had to Say About the Reserved List”. If it isn’t straight strategy or solid information:  we don’t share it.</p>
                                <p>This blog will be published every Sunday and it will preview the original blogs and posts
                                    that are to be released over the course of that week. “Poetically Aggro” for example, is a blog
                                    written about all things aggro in Magic: the Gathering. “Natty Dubs” is an RPG blog headed by
                                    Ryan that’s going to bring some very exciting D&D content like custom modules and character
                                    sheet conversions from other universes. We’ll be executing similar plans for Warhammer
                                    40,000, Pokémon and Flesh and Blood TCG further down the line. New realms will be
                                    opened in the future but will only be based on games we play and communities we are a part
                                    of. You can count on us to not shove crap content in your face so we can make a buck. You
                                    won’t see bad deck lists and primers that were clearly written just to sell cards from the new
                                    set.</p>
                                <p>So, check back often and stay awhile. We are very excited to be bringing with us for this next
                                    chapter, and to be providing content for you, our fellow gamer. We hope you enjoy what we have in store. Thank you for your prior and continued support.</p>
