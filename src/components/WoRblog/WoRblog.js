                <p>We created World of Realms to serve gamers. Our mission is to provide fellow nerds with the things they want, and that is how we’ve run the business from the start. From our card
prices to the content we have created thus far, World of Realms is here for you.</p>
                <p>With that  goal in mind, the natural step was to launch a website to
fill with content. We’re going to bring you original content based on games that WE ACTUALLY
play. There is a team of bloggers that will be working  tirelessly throughout the week. In addition to our original content, we are going to be filter out
all the garbage out there, and bring you only the news you need.. If we share an article from another site, we stand by it. It means the
information in the article is valid and relevant. No clickbait, no “This is what Richard Garfield
had to Say About the Reserved List”. If it isn’t straight strategy or solid information:  we don’t share it.</p>
<p>This blog will be published every Sunday and it will preview the original blogs and posts
that are to be released over the course of that week. “Poetically Aggro” for example, is a blog
written about all things aggro in Magic: the Gathering. “Natty Dubs” is an RPG blog headed by
Ryan that’s going to bring some very exciting D&D content like custom modules and character
sheet conversions from other universes. We’ll be executing similar plans for Warhammer
40,000, Pokémon and Flesh and Blood TCG further down the line. New realms will be
opened in the future but will only be based on games we play and communities we are a part
of. You can count on us to not shove crap content in your face so we can make a buck. You
won’t see bad deck lists and primers that were clearly written just to sell cards from the new
set.</p>
<p>So, check back often and stay awhile. We are very excited to be bringing with us for this next
chapter, and to be providing content for you, our fellow gamer. We hope you enjoy what we have in store. Thank you for your prior and continued support.</p>
