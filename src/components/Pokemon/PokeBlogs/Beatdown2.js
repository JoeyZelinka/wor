                                <p>In Pokémon, as you know,  you need to attach energy and attack to win. Well, unfortunately for the opponent, Galarian Cursola makes that a lot harder. This deck specializes in punishing your opponent for playing correctly.</p>
                                <img src="galariancurs.png" alt=""></img>
                                <p>Galarian Cursola V is the only attacker for the deck. For one psychic and one colorless, it does 60 to your opponent's active Pokémon, and drops 3 damage counters amongst your opponents benched Pokémon however you like. The best part of this Pokémon is it’s ability, “Gnawing Aura.” This ability triggers when an opponent attaches an energy to a Pokémon. It puts 3 whole damage counters on that Pokémon. For this ability to trigger, Cursola must be in the active. This deck only has Galarian Cursola V as a basic Pokémon, because it’s very important for it to be the active all game.</p>
                                <p>On the bench we have Arctozolt from Darkness Ablaze. It is a stage 1 lighting type with the ability “Biting Whirlpool.” This ability also triggers when an opponent attaches an energy to one of their Pokémon, and it puts 2 damage counters on that Pokémon. Best part is, you can stack as many Artozolts on your bench as you’d like!</p>
                                <img src="teamyellgrunt.png" alt=""></img>
                                <p>The most important trainer in this deck is Team Yell Grunt. This supporter places an energy attached to one of your opponents Pokemon into their hand. Then, they are forced to re-attach it to their Pokémon, putting more damage counters on it. Stacked up with the rest of this deck’s set up, this card does some major damage.</p>
                                <p>Another good trainer used here is Crushing Hammer. This is a card I use in many of my decks. It reads “Flip a coin. If heads, discard an energy attached to one of your opponents pokemon.” This is a good card to slow down your opponent and once again make your opponent play more energy from their hand.</p>
                                <p>Because Arctozolt evolves from Rare Fossil, and it is hard to search them out, I use 2 copies of Cara Lyss. This supporter searches out 2 Rare Fossils and places them onto your bench. It is a good way to set up your Arctozolt on the bench and causes more energy disruption.</p>
                                <p>With the good amount of basic Pokémon and basic energy, I use 3 Sonia’s. Sonia searches your deck for either 2 basic energy or 2 basic Pokémon. This is really good to either set up your attacks or get more Cursola to the bench.</p>
                                <img src="oldcemetery.png" alt=""></img>
                                <p>The stadium in this deck is very important to the deck's success. I use 3 copies of Old Cemetery. When Old cemetery is in play, when a player attaches an energy to one of their non-psychic Pokémon, you place 2 damage counters on that Pokémon. It doesn’t seem like much, but when combined with the rest of this deck, it is a very solid card.</p>
                                <p>The most important item in this deck is Fog Crystal. This card searches your deck for either 1 basic psychic Pokémon or 1 basic psychic energy. Not only is this card very versatile, but you can also use as many as you’d like in your turn!</p>
                                <p>Due to the hefty amount of supporters used in this deck, I also use 2 copies of Pokegear 3.0. It allows you to look at the top 7 cards of your deck and put a supporter you find into your hand. This has saved me in game many times and it is always helpful to use in a supporter heavy deck.</p>
                                <img src="ruggedhelmet.png" alt=""></img>
                                <p>The Pokémon Tool used in this deck is Rugged Helmet. When the Pokemon wearing this item is dealt damage, you may place an energy attached to that Pokemon into your opponent’s hand. This makes them have to re-attach that energy and put more damage onto that Pokemon. </p>
                                <p>For the energy base, including the Horror Energy, there are 12 all together. It is a little much, but I like having them easily accessible throughout the game. A useful but not extremely necessary card in this deck is the Horror Energy. When the Pokemon with this energy attached to it is dealt damage, 2 damage counters are placed on the attacking Pokemon. This helps to build up damage on your opponent’s active</p>
                                <p>As solid as this deck is, it does have a few weaknesses. One of them being Path to the Peak, a stadium that removes abilities of all Pokemon V’s. This takes away Cursola’s energy punishment and allows your opponent to freely play the game correctly, imagine that.</p>
                                <p>Overall, this is one of my favorite decks to use. I love how quick it is to set up. Also, I love thinking of my opponent not readING my cards and attaching an energy to a benched, low HP Pokémon, and it just getting KO’d right there. I bet the deck makes at least one little kid cry a day. </p>
