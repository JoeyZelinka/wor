                                <p>Everybody likes a good mill deck, well, everyone besides your opponent, that is. In almost any card game, when you can’t draw any cards, you lose. Ant Mill takes advantage of that rule, it is a very efficient deck that mills your opponent out and leaves them with no cards left in their deck. This is a very slept on deck in my opinion, and I’d love to shine some light on it. A copy of Durant goes for only $0.04 on TCGplayer, so this deck is very easy on your wallet.</p>
                                <p>The main attacker is Durant, a grass type Pokemon with 90 HP, out of Battle Styles. It’s attack, Devour, mills the top card of your opponent’s deck for each Durant you have in play. This removes many useful cards from your opponent’s deck and puts the pressure on them. </p>
                                <img src="mew.jpg" alt=""></img>
                                <p>Because of all the item cards in this deck, I put in 2 copies of Mew, from Celebrations. When Mew is in the active spot, you may look at the top 6 cards of your deck and choose an item card you find there. Best part is, Mew is also under 90 HP. How convenient!</p>
                                <img src="dunsparce.png" alt=""></img>
                                <p>The last Pokemon I use is Dunsparce, out of Darkness Ablaze. It’s ability, Final Dig, mills the top 2 cards of your opponent's deck. Dunsparce is out into the active when I am setting up, or at the very end of the game.</p>
                                <p>This is a very trainer heavy deck, almost 75% of it in fact. A few of these trainers either find your Durant’s or pull them out of your discard pile, because at 90 HP, they are very knock out prone. A majority of the trainers are for disruption. </p>
                                <img src="crush.jpg" alt=""></img>
                                <p>Ant Mill has 4 crushing hammers, which flip a coin. A heads will discard a card from one of your opponent's Pokemon. This is a great way of slowing down your opponent from setting up their playing field.</p>
                                <p>There is also a combination of Boss’s Order and Galar Mine. Boss’s order pulls one of your opponent’s benched Pokemon from their bench to the active. With Galar Mine, their retreat cost is 2 more. So if they use Air Balloons, it would take them a very long time to set up a retreat. If they play a card like Crobat V, who is used for its “put into play” ability, it can get stuck in active, and you are free to mill away at their deck as much as you want.</p>
                                <p>Another useful trainer is Bruno. He shuffles your had into your deck and allows you to draw 4. Best part is, if your Pokemon was knocked out last turn, you draw 7 instead of 4! Due to how easy it is to KO a Durant, you will often find yourself drawing 7.</p>
                                <img src="cursedshov.jpg" alt=""></img>
                                <p>A tool card I use is Cursed Shovel. When the Pokémon it is attached to is knocked out, your opponent mills the top 2 cards of their deck. It may not seem like much, but it certainly adds up.</p>
                                <img src="rescue.jpg" alt=""></img>
                                <p>Due to how many Durants can end up in your discard pile, Rescue Carrier is a must. They take 2 Pokemon with 90 HP or less from your discard pile and put them into your hand. This can get any of your Durants back into action. For when you need to search out Durant, Dunsparce, or Mew, we look to our Level Balls. This can search out any Pokémon 90 HP or lower. Of course we run 4 copies of it!</p>
                                <p>The supporters in this deck are pretty important, and Mew can’t get them with its ability. This got me to add a 3 Pokegear 3.0. It is an item card that lets you look at the top 7 cards of your deck and take a supporter you find there. It is a bit hard to find the one you’re looking for, being that you have to go from top 6 Pokegear to a top 7 supporter, but it has worked out well for me personally in the past.</p>
                                <p>This is not an energy heavy deck, it only requires 8. 4 twin energy and 4 capture energy. Durant’s attack requires 2 colorless, so a twin energy would do just perfect. Capture energies supply 1 colorless, but when you attach it to a Pokémon, it allows you to search your deck for a basic Pokémon and put it onto your bench. </p>
                                <p>Usually for me, Ant Mill takes about 2-3 turns to set up, and once it is set up, with a hand of trainers to cause disruption, it is very hard to stop it.</p>
