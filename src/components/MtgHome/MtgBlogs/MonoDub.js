                            <p>Disclaimer: I am not a pro. Though, you probably already knew that since you have never heard of me in Magic. I’ve been playing Magic for a long time but Arena only since June. In my time on Arena, I’ve spent $20 by accident (long story). In paper Magic I play 5 Color Humans in Modern (some might call me the “Humans Guy” here in Atlanta). I attend as many Competitive REL in Atlanta and the surrounding areas as I can. Like I said I’m not a pro, but I’ve probably gotten smashed by your favorite pro player. This blog is for regular players who make mistakes, play through them and want to be as competitive as possible. “Poetically Aggro” is just my perspective and knowledge of all things aggro.</p>

                            <p>Before Crimson Vow, this deck was weird. At first glance, it looked like your standard (pun intended) white weenie deck. But it synergized in wonky and unexpected ways, as if this hodgepodge of cards COULD come together at the right time to win you the game. If you’re still playing Clarion Spirit or Usher of the Fallen…stop. Those cards are remnants of a mediocre build that was tier 2 at best. I would know. I was getting smashed after my Orzhov Humans (see Historic primer) deck rotated out. That was until…Crimson Vow dropped.</p>
                            <p>Now, this deck crushes souls. The addition of Hopeful Initiate and my favorite human woman in ALL of Magic, Thalia, has clearly put Mono Dub over the edge. The combination of aggression and disruption warms the cockles of my heart. The amount of tax one can stack onto an opponent’s spells makes me chuckle to myself on a regular basis. Let’s get into it.</p>
                            <p>Allow me to address the elephant in the room, I main board 3 Curse of Silence and if you don’t like it, fight me. With how predatory the meta is to this deck it’s more than justified. I almost created a naming guide but, as anyone who is in the Modern Humans Facebook group can tell you, naming is so situational you’re doing yourself a disservice by trying to automate the naming instead of thinking critically. You generally want to wait for a Spellbinder to reveal what to name. All that in mind, there’s nothing wrong with dropping it when you know in your crotch that your opponent just Foretold an Epiphany. Your opponent dropped a second black source on turn 2? Name The Meathook Massacre. Just know if you don’t close it out quick Blood on the Snow is coming to f$#k your day up. Ok I’m done now. We can get to the cards that commonly comprise the deck.</p>

                            <p><em>A hasty trade, hold the Haste.</em></p>
                            <p>At first, I wasn’t sold on Hopeful Initiate but now I can see the value in this card. It synergizes seamlessly with the higher-powered creatures and a bigger booty(toughness) never hurt anyone. The things my opponents are willing to do to get rid of Stonebinder’s Familiar is almost comical at times. People have been abused by huge Stonebinders so often, they are MORE than willing to trade with that creature EARLY. So, tread lightly when swinging early into your opponent’s creatures, thinking they won’t block. </p>

                            <p><em>Oh you have the board? That's cute.</em></p>                            
                            <p>If you don’t know Thalia’s value…that’s ok, I’d still explain it to you, but my tone of voice would be rude at best. Intrepid Adversary is a little flimsy and gets smoked on sight when cast as a two drop. If you can wait for the 4 mana to pay their cost AND the trigger cost, do it. However, if you have more than one in hand and your opponent has no creatures? Cast one on turn 2. At that point, there’s nothing wrong with a 6-life point differential on turn 3. Luminarch Aspirant(what did they do to you in Historic?!?!) is what they’ve always been in this Standard…a beat down engine and spot removal target. Sungold Sentinel is the dark horse MVP of this deck. I’m not even talking about the obvious first ability either. That activated ability is so forgotten that I have won countless mirror matches against opponents that had their own Sungold on the battlefield. I’ll be completely honest; I still don’t understand what constitutes a “Power” but as soon as the border on that card lights up…it’s on.</p>
                            <img src="morespellbinders.png" alt=""></img>
                            <p><em>Elite Spellbinder decides yet another mirror match.</em></p>
                            <p>Brutal Cathar is straight gas. If you can manipulate its “flip” it can win you the game easily. The mirror match comes down to one thing and one thing only, whomever sees the most Elite Spellbinders wins the game. Disruption on a flying body, I don’t really have to type anymore. Reidane, God of the Worthy balls out. The snow land nerf coupled with the noncreature spell tax is incredibly stifling. It should probably be 4 mana to be honest. But the often-neglected other side of the card is what I like. If I play that side in the mirror or against a similar aggro-type deck, then I know the pause my opponent just took was because they don’t realize what just happened. Adeline, Resplendent Cathar helps you go wide while providing solid defense. I hate Skyclave Apparition, but you must play it and that’s all I want to say about it.</p>
                            <img src="counterontoken.png" alt=""></img>
                            <p><em>Here I put the counter on the token as to not miss out on Training triggers.</em></p>
                            <p>Let’s talk about solid lines of play in MOST situations. Turn 1 Stonebinder into turn 2 Thalia into turn 3 Sungold exiling whatever instant or sorcery that rocked Thalia on turn 2, feels good to say the least. Hopeful Initiate into any of the two drops is always going to be good. Personally, I like Hopeful into Luminarch. But you must be mindful of where you’re putting the counter. You are missing out on Training triggers if you put Luminarch’s counter on a creature arbitrarily. The greatest board state in this build, and it doesn’t happen often, is having your opponent’s win condition named with Curse stacked with Thalia, Spellbinder and Reidane’s taxes. I would pay to see my opponent’s face while this savagery takes place.</p>
                            <p>This deck can obviously get you to Mythic. But understand, they are gunning for you. You’ll have to be smart, vigilant and disciplined to win in this meta. One thing I’ve learned from playing 5C Humans all these years is it’s way easier to play when the deck ISN’T on top. But you don’t have that luxury so deal with it.</p>
                            <p>Until next time…and  f%&k a boardwipe!</p>
