                                <p>Disclaimer: This is a joke. Please, don’t take it seriously. We’re just having some fun.</p>
                                <p>There is nothing, I repeat NOTHING that leaves an aggro player seething more than a board wipe. The constant stress of having to play around a sweeper, playing nothing after turn 3 because your opponent might wipe their a$$ with your whole board, it can be a lot to deal with. So, here we are, taking one back for the aggro player. Today, we are discussing the most prominent board wipes that read “Destroy all/each”.</p>

                                <p><ins>Supreme Verdict</ins></p>
                                <p>Players who run Verdict are on the snobbier end of the spectrum. They are mostly known for condescendingly telling me what a card does, after I ask for the oracle text of a card, in their deck comprised of ALL FOREIGN LANGUAGE CARDS. Foiled out of course.</p>

                                <p>What can I say? Luck is just on your side. Winning through a mulligan to 4 is business as usual for you. You’ve only survived this long in life by great metaphoric “top decks”. Go buy a f#$%ing lottery ticket.</p>
                                <p><img src="wrath.jpg" alt="src"></img></p>
                                <p><ins>Wrath of God</ins></p>
                                <p>Does anyone actually play this anymore? The answer is yes. Wrath is played by the self-righteous boomer. You can spot them easy. Wrath players can be always heard saying things like “In my day white had the board wipes and you paid a fair rate for it”. Go take a nap before your dinner at 4pm.</p>

                                <p>You’re a goth. You hang outside the mall smoking clove cigarettes and terrorizing Hot Topic. The MtG poetry is as bad as your attitude. Hit the bathroom, your eye makeup is running.</p>

                                <p>You’re a degenerate gambler. No two ways about it. You are totally willing to mortgage the future for the present. Also, chances are you buy booster boxes to get singles instead of just buying the singles you need.</p>

                                <p><ins>Doomskar</ins></p>
                                <p>Doomskar players are into weird sex stuff. Things that probably originated in Germany. Sex swings, nipple clamps, ball gags OH MY! Could you put that thing away? This is a Magic tournament, and I don’t know where it’s been.</p>

                                <p>You just might be the next Unabomber. You’ve owned a published copy of “The Anarchist’s Cookbook” since your formative years. You were convinced that WotC was tracking you through your DCI number. Now, you’re positive the Companion app is listening.</p>

                                <p><ins>Ratchet Bomb</ins></p>
                                <p>People who sleeve up Ratchet Bomb are the contrarian punk rockers who don’t like anything popular. One can often hear them saying things like “I liked Magic: the Gathering before it went commercial”. Sure you’re a free spirit but, no one likes hanging out with you.</p>

                                <p>First off, you probably play commander so you already have a ton problems. But, digging deeper we can tell your just a sadist who is NEVER satisfied. 50 shades of…..what the f#$k are you into!?</p>
                                <p>I hope you enjoyed the first installment of “What Your Choice of Board Wipe Says About You in Real Life” from “Poetically Aggro”. If not, then you probably play one or more of these cards and I don’t care about your feelings.</p>
                                <p>Until next time…and f%&k a board wipe!!!</p>
