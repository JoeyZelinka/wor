                                <div className="byline">By Tyler Leavitt January 1st, 2022</div>
                                <p>Hello again everyone! Last week, I covered the Mechanicus. This week, I’ll be covering a few factions actually. I’ll first be covering the Custodes as the last major Imperium faction, and then next week we’ll finally be getting into Chaos and Xenos. Afterwards, I’ll be covering some factions I missed or forgot about. For the most part, these other factions are more “expansion” factions than anything else. They offer some units to bolster one of the other Imperium factions, but outside of one faction, they’re not able to be fielded just by themselves. As such, I won’t be giving any lists, or comparing their unit stats. Just keep them in mind when you’re looking at making an Imperium force. Now, let’s get on with the show!</p>
                                <p><b>Adeptus Custodes - The Protectors of the Golden Throne</b></p>
                                <img src="custodesvsorks.jpg" alt=""></img>
                                <p><em>A Custodes shield host holding the line against an Ork WAAAAGH. Artist is unknown, but comes from Warhammer Community.</em></p>
                                <p>Ah, the glorious Custodes. The Custodes first show up in lore around the same time as the Unification of Terra under the Emperor. The Emperor chose a number of people as his “companions” that would act as his aides, confidants, bodyguards, and everything in between. They are loyal to the Emperor and ONLY the Emperor. As such, much of their lore is combined with the Emperor’s lore, even after the Horus Heresy. After the Emperor was put onto the Golden Throne, the Custodes felt that they had failed him, and so they vowed to never leave his side. For Nearly 10,000 years, they stayed true to their word. It was only recently that the Custodes began to venture out once again and fight in the Emperor’s name.</p>
                                <p>Honestly, there’s not a whole lot of lore to be said here. The Custodes have very rarely done anything that doesn’t relate to the Emperor, until only recently. Even then, they were only acting in the interests of the Emperor rather than the Imperium itself.</p>
                                <img src="custodeslist.png" alt=""></img>
                                <p>What about for stats? The Custodes are the guards of the Emperor, so what kind of equipment do they get? Well, as you can imagine, the Custodes lie on the far end of the spectrum when it comes to their base statline. Their movement is on par, as we’ve seen before. However, a 2+ weapon and ballistic skill, a 5 strength and toughness, a whopping 3 wounds, 3 attacks, and a 2+ armor save? No other basic troop compares to these Custodians. There’s only two downsides: one, you have a minimum of 3 units per squad, up to a maximum of 10. This may not seem bad, until you take into account their point cost at 45pts per unit. If you play a normal game at 2000pts, a 10 unit squad is nearly a quarter of your list. Two, the Guardian Spear’s ranged profile isn’t the best. However, this more than makes up for it with the melee profile. The ranged is just icing on the cake, as they can still move and fire while closing the distance. Additionally, ALL Custodian units have the Aegis of the Emperor ability, which grants them a 5+ invulnerable save, and a chance to ignore a psychic wound. Both are very useful.</p>
                                <p>This all tells us that this army is the pinnacle of quality over quantity. You can’t field nearly as many troops as any other factions, but you don’t have to. Each of your units is a killing machine. They are able to shrug off any shots from nearly every single weapon besides the heaviest ones, and they can dish out the damage right back at the enemy. The only downside of the Custodes is the lack of objective holding. Sure you have quality, but sometimes you just need bodies to secure objectives. However, if you’re looking to play on a budget, the Custodes are the way to go. My starter list, as you’ll see in a moment, is a total of 13 models. Yes, you heard me right: 13 models. They may not be the best faction, but they are super cheap to buy and build. So if you have a budget you’re playing on, consider the Custodes a try. Now, let’s get on with the list.</p>
                                <p><b>Adeptus Custodes Army (980pts):</b></p>
                                <p>Shield Host: N/A</p>
                                <p>The Shield Host doesn’t matter for Custodes too much. It doesn’t provide any kind of faction wide buff like every other faction’s choice does. Instead, it offers you a warlord trait, a relic option, and a special command ability. Honestly, go through them all, and use what you think you’d like best, and modify your HQ accordingly.</p>
                                <p>HQ: Shield Captain in Allarus Terminator Armor, 115pts; Castellan Axe, Emperor’s Companion warlord trai</p>
                                <p>The Shield Captain is your basic HQ unit choice. When making the list, I typically try to go as basic as possible with the HQ unit, but I saw I had some extra points to spend and figured it would be helpful to upgrade him to Terminator Armor. I would’ve preferred giving him a Jetbike, but that put me over 1000pts. The Terminator armor is still incredibly good though, and you’ll find your Shield Captain to hit incredibly hard. That’s why I chose to go with the Emperor’s Companion warlord trait, as you can reroll the damage on your attacks in an attempt to hit even harder. Another good choice would be Radiant Mantle to give him even more survivability; ultimately, it’s your choice.</p>
                                <p>Troops: 2 Custodian Guard Squad, 180pts; 4 Custodians with Guardian Spears each.</p>
                                <p>What can I say here that I haven’t said before? Get them in melee and watch them kill everyone and everything. Alternatively, you can equip one squad with Sentinel Blades and Storm Shields while dropping a Custodes. This’ll make them even tougher with a 4+ invulnerable save, but you might lose a bit on damage. The choice is up to you, I think one extra model is a better choice than getting swords and shields.</p>
                                <p>Fast Attack: Vertus Praetors, 255pts; 3 Vertus Praetors with Salvo Launchers</p>
                                <p>Custodes on bikes! Not much to really say here, they go fast, and hit hard in melee. I chose to give them Salvo Launchers as an anti-armor tool.</p>
                                <p>Dedicated Transport: Coronus Grav-Carrier, 250pts</p>
                                <p>And lastly, a transport unit. It can carry one of the Custodian squads up above and get them to the front. The weapons are also pretty good, with plenty of anti-infantry and anti-tank options, and the unit is pretty tanky with 18 wounds. Not much else to say.</p>
                                <p>And there you have it, the Custodes. Honestly, this was going to be pretty easy to write. I don’t really have much to say about them; they’re extremely high quality units, and can be pretty fun to play. They’re definitely not one of my favorite factions, I think they’re a bit too niche and can be hard for other factions to counter. However, that’s enough about the Custodes. As I said in the beginning of the article, I’m going to quickly go through all the other Imperium factions I either missed or forgot about, starting with…</p>
                                <br />
                                <p><b>The Grey Knights</b></p>
                                <img src="greyknights.jpg" alt=""></img>
                                <p><em>Some unique painted Grey Knights. Artist is GMM Studios, a painting studio.</em></p>
                                <p>Yeah, I’ll be honest, I completely forgot the Grey Knights existed. That’s not to say they’re a bad faction; in fact, they’re pretty good. So, what are the Grey Knights? They’re a specialist faction of Space Marines created to counter daemons and psykers. As such, each Grey Knight is a psyker themselves. If you play Grey Knights, you’ll find that you’ll have no difficulties countering any faction that uses psykers or daemons. Plus, having psykers everywhere can be pretty useful. This is the only faction I forgot about that can be considered their own “full” faction, but I won’t give you a list. They’re pretty easy to figure out, though.</p>
                                <p><b>Officio Assassinorum</b></p>
                                <img src="officio.jpg" alt=""></img>
                                <p><em>The four different kinds of assassins from the Officio Assassinorum. I believe this is official art.</em></p>
                                <p>The Officio Assassinorum can be added into any other Imperium faction. Personally, I really love the flavor of each assassin and what they can bring to the table. I love the Vindicare personally, as I’ve always loved sniper characters and units, but sadly generic 40k sniper units don’t represent what they can actually do. The Vindicare does. All in all, the Assassinorum has some really fun models, and I highly recommend looking at them if you are making an Imperium army.</p>
                                <p><b>The Inquisition</b></p>
                                <img src="inquisitor.jpg" alt=""></img>
                                <p><em>Inquisitor Adrastia, of the Ordo Hereticus. Art is taken from Dawn of War 2: Retribution.</em></p>
                                <p>Inquisitors are the big bad boogeyman of the 40k universe in the Imperium. They act as judge, jury, and executioners in their field of expertise. The Inquisition offers some decent HQ choices if you want to add them in, but personally, they’re not my thing. Oh, they also have some Elite units. If you want to go with an Inquisition themed army, add on an Inquisitor with Sororitas, Grey Knights, or Imperial Guard Tempestus Scions.</p>
                                <p><b>Sisters of Silence</b></p>
                                <p><img src="silence.jpg" alt=""></img></p>
                                <p><em>A Sisters of Silence Prosecutor Squad holding the line against unknown foes. I believe this is also official art.</em></p>
                                <p>Do you have an absolute vendetta against psykers? Consider adding in a few Sisters of Silence into your army. These units are considered “Nulls” in the Warp, meaning they have no presence in the Warp. As such, they cannot be affected by psychic powers, and can extend this “null” field around them to make it harder to use psychic powers on nearby units. Additionally, the Sisters of Silence destroy any psykers or daemons. If you find yourself up against a ton of daemons or psykers, throw in a unit or two of Sisters of Silence.</p>
                                <p>Aaaand I think that’s it! That’s all of the Imperium factions! Of course, I’m missing a few, such as specific Space Marine chapters or Imperial Guard regiments, or the Imperial Knights and Titans, but honestly you can figure them out on their own. Honestly, the Imperium isn’t my favorite, and many people find that Games Workshop loves to push out Imperium factions every chance they get. The only exception is with the Guard, as there’s a ton of cool regiments from them that get no love.</p>
                                <p>Regardless! I hope you all enjoyed. Next week, I plan on covering the entirety of Chaos, which is going to be an incredibly long article. I’ll have to cover Chaos Space Marines, each Chaos God’s specific Space Marine faction, and their daemons. However, they all can be tied into each other. But, that’s a story for next week. I hope everyone has a good week, and may the dice gods favor you!</p>
