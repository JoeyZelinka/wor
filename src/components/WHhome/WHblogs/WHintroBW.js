                                <div className="byline">By Tyler Leavitt November 1st, 2021</div>
                                <p>I’m back to continue my introduction into Warhammer 40k! Last week, I gave a general introduction into the universe and how best to get started in the hobby. The next month or two I’ll be talking about the various factions in depth. I will cover each faction’s lore and background, how they play, and give some tips for starting armies or how to develop an army. Please know that while I am experienced, I don’t know each faction in depth. I don’t know the best strategies with everyone, but I know general strategies and builds that seem good to me. With that out of the way, let’s begin with the angels of death: the Space Marines!</p>
                                <p><b>Adeptus Astartes - The Angels of Death</b></p>
                                <img src="imperialfist.jpg" alt=""></img>
                                <p><em>An Imperial Fist marine holds the line. Artist credit: Anonymous, found on WallpaperFlare.</em></p>
                                <p>To start off with, let’s talk about the poster boys for 40k: the Adeptus Astartes, or Space Marines. The space marines were created when the Emperor of Mankind first went out to reclaim all human worlds back into his new Imperium. He created 20 children that would become known as the Primarchs. From these Primarchs, he then created 20 legions of space marines, each the genetic children of the Primarchs. The space marines would serve as the main fighting force of the Imperium until the end of the Horus Heresy, which saw the Imperium split by a massive civil war. Primarchs and space marines fought each other in bloody battle, and in the end the Emperor sacrificed himself to defeat his fallen children.</p>
                                <p>After the Horus Heresy, one of the loyalist Primarchs named Roboute Guilliman created the “Codex Astartes,” rules that would dictate the formation and strategies of the space marines. No longer would they be organized into massive legions; instead, they would be formed into 1000 man “Chapters,” made of 10 companies with 10 squads each. In the year M42, most loyalist Chapters still follow these rules laid out in the Codex. However, there are a few that deviate from it, but are still loyal servants of the Emperor.</p>
                                <p>Being the poster boys for what represents Warhammer 40k, the space marines get the most love of any faction in the entire game. For those who read my last 40k article, you’ll remember that I recommend the space marines as the best faction to get into the game, and I still stand by that statement. The truth is, the space marines have some of the most well rounded troops out of any faction. They don’t excel at any area in particular, making them a jack of all trades faction. This allows a new player to expand their space marine roster into several different directions, or play as space marines until they learn what they enjoy doing, and then get into a faction that does it better. You’ll find that your stats are usually the ones that most people compare their own troops to as a baseline. Let’s take a look at the two main frontline troops you’ll have as a space marine player: the Intercessor Squad, and Tactical Squad.</p>
                                <img src="astartescard.png" alt=""></img>
                                <p>This will be your Tactical Squad. These consist of the original space marines before getting the “rework” into Primaris marines, which are just brand new space marines. A tactical squad can consist of a minimum of 4 space marines and a sergeant, up to 7 space marines, a heavy weapons marine, a special weapon marine, and the sergeant. The weapons specialists give your marines extra flexibility in combat with a variety of weapons, but I won’t cover those for now. Right now, pay attention to the stats. A space marine can move 6”, which is about average. They have a weapon and ballistic skill of 3+, which means that they’re hitting a bit more than half the time, as you’re hitting on 3 or above on a D6. Your strength and toughness are average for a troop choice at 4s. You get 2 wounds, which is above average for most troops and is remarkably tough. 1 attack (2 on the sergeant) which is normal. A 7 leadership is fairly average once again, and a 3+ armor save is pretty good. All of this combines into a fairly resilient and adaptable troop choice.</p>
                                <img src="intercessorcard.png" alt=""></img>
                                <p>Next, let me talk about the Primaris Intercessors. When looking at these compared to the tactical marines, you’ll notice two main things: one, these guys are more expensive. And two, they have the same statline as the tactical marines. And for both, you’d be correct. The area that the intercessors have a difference in are their weapons, the Bolt Rifle compared to the standard Bolter, or Boltgun. The Bolt Rifle has an extra 6” of range, and AP -1. This makes your baseline marine have much more ranged firepower than the tactical marine, but there’s more. You lose the ability to take specialist weapons marines from the squad; instead, you can take grenade launchers, or 3 different types of rifles. This means that while the squad has less flexibility than the tactical squad, they have more anti-infantry firepower than them too.</p>
                                <p>In the end however, these are the stats that most people will compare their own troops to. For all of my faction introductions, I’ll also be making comparisons to these space marines as well. Now, how about some lists? I’ll give a few starting lists at 1000 points. Most battles are fought at 2000 points, so this gives you some choices for how you want to grow the army as well.</p>
                                <p>Beginner Army Non-Primaris (990 points):</p>
                                <p>This list will have no Primaris marines in it, and instead focus on the original space marines.</p>
                                <p>Ultramarines Chapter: No reason in particular for this choice, other than it being a good baseline chapter to start with. You can easily switch this out for any other chapter.</p>
                                <p>HQ: Captain, 95pts; Iron Resolve warlord trait, Master Crafted Boltgun, Relic Blade. The captain is your baseline HQ unit without getting into anything else. He’s generic, but he’ll do just fine for a starting army. He has the master crafted boltgun and a relic blade, giving him both ranged and melee staying power. The Iron Resolve warlord trait also makes him tougher to kill, which is a good starting trait while you’re learning the game.</p>
                                <p>Troops: Tactical Squad, 200pts; 7 space marines, 1 sergeant, marine with heavy bolter, marine with plasma gun. Tactical Squad, 205pts; 7 space marines, 1 sergeant, marine with lascannon, marine with meltagun.</p>
                                <p>Here I’ve given you two squads of tactical marines, both geared towards different roles. The first squad has a heavy bolter and plasma gun, giving it more anti-infantry firepower. The second squad has a lascannon and meltagun, giving it more anti-armor firepower.</p>
                                <p>Elites: Dreadnought, 120pts; Assault cannon, Dreadnought combat weapon w/ Storm BolterThe Dreadnought is one of the most iconic units of the space marines. A large war walker with a giant fist and a massive support cannon. Yes please! This loadout makes the dreadnought a jack of all trades unit; assault cannon and storm bolter give some massive ranged firepower, while the combat weapon gives it a mean melee weapon.</p>
                                <p>Fast Attack: Assault Squad, 130pts; 3 space marines, sergeant with combat shield and thunder hammer, marine w/ Eviscerator, jump packs.Here we have your main melee squad. The jump packs give the squad 6” extra movement, which means they can quickly get into combat. The eviscerator and thunder hammer give a massive boost in melee, while the combat shield gives the sergeant a bit of durability with an invulnerability save.</p>
                                <p>Heavy Support: Devastator Squad, 150pts; 1 sergeant, 1 marine with heavy bolter, 1 marine with plasma cannon, 1 marine with lascannon, 1 marine with multi-melta. This is your main ranged squad. I have it built to be extremely flexible with the weapon choices; the heavy bolter is for anti-infantry, plasma cannon for a heavy AOE infantry or armor tool, lascannon for armor, and multi-melta for close-ranged firepower.</p>
                                <p>Dedicated Transport: Rhino, 90pts; 2x Storm bolters, Hunter-killer missile Lastly is a Rhino. This Rhino has a bit of firepower, but that’s not the main reason why it’s here. The reason is because it can carry 10 marines, which gives you some extra maneuverability. Combine this with devastators, and you’ll find that you can drop your devastators right into the middle of battle where they’re needed. The rhino can also act as a good defensive tool too, so use it to your advantage!</p>
                                <p>Beginner Primaris Army (997pts):</p>
                                <p>This army will focus solely on Primaris marines.</p>
                                <p>Ultramarines Chapter: Same reason as above. No real good reason, it’s just a good beginning chapter to get introduced with.</p>
                                <p>HQ: Primaris Captain, 90pts; Iron Resolve warlord trait, Master-crafted auto bolt rifle. A similar loadout to the captain as above, but you’ll notice the lack of a melee weapon. Primaris are going to be stronger shooting wise than the normal space marines, which will be a theme throughout the list.</p>
                                <p>Troops: Heavy Intercessor Squad, 140pts, 4 intercessors, 1 sergeant; x2 Intercessor Squad, 180pts; 8 intercessors, 1 sergeant. You’re losing more bodies per squad here compared to the normal marines. However, you make up for it in how much more powerful your weapons are. You can easily drop the heavy intercessors for more normal intercessors, or a third squad of them. I added them in as they’re a longer ranged anti-infantry option if you wanted to use them. I have them equipped with the Executor bolt rifle as AP is pretty good, especially in an anti-infantry role, but as I said you might want to drop these for more Intercessors.</p>
                                <p>Elites: Aggressor Squad, 270pts; 2 Aggressors, 1 Sergeant w/ Boltstorm Gauntlets and Fragstorm Grenade Launcher; Reiver Squad, 180pts; 8 Reivers, Reiver Sergeant w/ combat knife</p>
                                <p>Something you’ll notice is that the melee firepower (Reivers) and what I’m deeming the ranged firepower (Aggressors) are counted as elites rather than heavy support and fast attack like above. I’m not sure the exact reason for it, other than the Primaris get all the love. Anyways, the Aggressors at the very least fulfill a different role from the Devastators. They don’t have long range; instead, they have heavier AOE boltstorm gauntlets with blast to really tear into hordes of enemies. Reivers are still similar to the assault squad, but they don’t have jump packs which impacts their speed. In turn, they get the Terror Troops aura, which lowers leadership for enemies close to them.</p>
                                <p>Dedicated Transport: Impulsor, 110pts; 2x storm bolters. Lastly is the Impulsor, which will fulfill a role similar to the Rhino. It carries less troops than the Rhino, 6 compared to 10, but in turn it’s slightly faster, and a bit tougher. It also has the Assault Vehicle ability, which gives even more bang for your buck than the Rhino. Combine with Heavy Intercessors for a fast and mobile hit squad.</p>

                                <p><em>The Primaris of the Ultramarines march to war!</em></p>
                                <p>With these lists, you can branch out depending on what you enjoyed doing in a few games. Do you enjoy melee? Then perhaps going into Space Wolves or Black Templars, and then getting more melee focused troops. Like ranged? Maybe Imperial Fists or Salamanders then. Want more toughness? Iron Hands. As for units, there’s an absolute ton of them, so you have a lot of ways to expand your burgeoning space marine army!</p>
                                <p>That will be all from me for today. Next week, I plan on continuing on with the Imperium of Man by looking at one of my favorite factions, the Astra Militarum, or Imperial Guard. May the dice gods favor you!</p>

                                <p>Hello everyone! My name is Tyler, and I’m here to act as your guide into the wonderful world of… wait, no, wrong game. I’m here to guide you through the depressing yet still badass universe of Warhammer 40,000. Whether you’re completely new to the game, or a veteran, my goal is to help you learn something about it.</p>
                                <p>So… why get into Warhammer 40,000? Maybe you have some friends who play it and you wanted to join in. Maybe you saw the pretty miniatures in your local game store. Maybe you just like the aesthetic. Everyone joins the game for their own reasons, and they have their own ways of enjoying the universe. Personally, I love learning about the lore, which often impacts how I want to play the game itself. I’m not concerned about what the most overpowered faction is, I just want to enjoy the factions I like from the lore. Of course, you CAN be competitive as well, but that’s not my realm of expertise. Instead, I’ll give a brief rundown on the universe and the game itself, alongside giving some starter tips to help you if you have nothing to start with!</p>
                                <p><ins>The Universe</ins></p>
                                <p>As I mentioned before, I love learning and talking about the lore. There’s so much to talk about though that it can be a bit overwhelming to start! The general summary I always give to new people is this:</p>
                                <p>The universe is in the 42nd millennium. Humanity has spread across the stars, forming a great empire known as the Imperium of Man. However, they are always at war, either with aliens (called xenos) or locked in a long civil war amongst themselves with the forces of Chaos. The brave men and women of the Imperium have to face down terrible odds, against the massive green hordes of the Orks, the technological supremacy and fearsome battlesuits of the Tau, or the ever consuming hunger of the Tyranids… </p>
                                <img src="nids.jpg" alt=""></img>
                                <p>Brave soldiers of the Imperial Guard, facing down a Tyranid invasion. Artist credit: lathander1987 on Deviantart.</p>
                                <p>And yet, the Imperium of Man holds against these threats. The Imperial Guard, the main military fighting force of the Imperium, holds the line against these foes with a seemingly endless supply of manpower, and the thunder of their mighty guns and tanks.</p>
                                <p>However, the one thing that everyone knows from Warhammer 40k are the mighty space marines. Tall, strong, and heavily armored, the space marines fight wherever they are needed. A squad of space marines can easily turn the tide of battle for the Imperium.</p>
                                <p>Besides the space marines, the other main fighting force of the Imperium are the Sisters of Battle. They are religious fanatics, fighting to the death for the God Emperor of Mankind. They can best be described as battle nuns. Prayers and hymns protect them in battle, while they march forward and burn the heretics and xenos. </p>

                                <p><em>Ultramarines fighting in close quarters combat against the Orks. Artist credit: ukitakumuki on Deviantart.</em></p>
                                <p>There’s a ton of other things I haven’t touched on, but there are plenty of ways to learn about the universe if you’re interested. Personally, one of my favorite things to do is to use the Warhammer 40k wikipedia to go delving into a topic. I’ll pick something that interests me, and start reading the article. If I find something else I want to read or learn about, I’ll open up a new tab with it to read later. There are also a ton of videos on YouTube as well! My personal favorite is 40k Theories’ 40k Lore for Newcomers. He goes over a lot of lore topics in Warhammer 40k and explains them for you. He also has a pretty good timeline video of the entire 40k universe. Bricky has a few videos explaining each faction in 40k; he explains them in a comedic fashion, but they’re good explanations. Adeptus Ridiculous also has a ton of lore videos. Find something that suits you, and listen to them while in the car or working on something else!</p>

                                <p><ins>The Game</ins></p>
                                <p>Now… onto the game itself. Let me preface this by saying that the hobby is expensive, especially for some factions. There are easy ways of getting past this however, and other ways to enjoy Warhammer in terms of video games. Let me start by talking about the tabletop wargame, however. </p>
                                <p>When you first look at starting an army, you’re going to notice the awesome paint jobs that people have done online or on the box. They do not come like this; they don’t even come built. You will have to build your figures yourself, and paint them yourself (or get a friend to do it). Before you turn away or think to yourself that there’s no way you can paint them, that’s what the internet is for! There are plenty of guides to help you, and don’t give up if your first models don’t turn out well! The main thing with building and painting is learning. Keep practicing and keep learning, and you’ll find yourself improving with each model you paint!</p>
                                <img src="plastic.jpg" alt=""></img>
                                <p><em>Some unpainted Primaris Marines, standing with some Warhammer Fantasy models.</em></p>
                                <p>As for the game itself, there’s plenty of armies, and for some armies in particular, there can be a ton of models to look through. The next question you should ask yourself about starting an army is: what is my budget? What am I looking for in an army? I plan on doing more in depth looks into each of the factions, but if you know nothing about the universe and don’t want to spend much on the game, there’s a way to enjoy the game without busting the bank. </p>
                                <p>And that would be Kill Team, or Kill Team Classic rather. Warhammer 40k focuses on large armies duking it out on the battlefield, and with how many squads you need or heavy firepower, the costs can tally up quickly. With Kill Team, it focuses on an elite squad combat system. Each faction is narrowed down to a select few models, and there’s your entire list. For some factions, you can easily get away with purchasing a single box of models. Kill Team Classic still plays in a very similar fashion to standard 40k as well, meaning that you can learn the intricacies of the game without getting too invested into it. </p>
                                <p>And for those of you wondering why I say “Kill Team Classic,” well there’s a reason for that. The recent edition to Kill Team changed the game entirely, making it a completely new game rather than a small scale 40k. You can still use the models from the new edition though, and there are some beautiful models that come with the starter kit. But I would recommend finding a PDF of Kill Team Classic online and starting there.</p>
                                <img src="orkvsnazi.jpg" alt="orkvsnazi"></img>
                                <p>After getting your feet wet with Kill Team, or maybe you have some friends who are willing to tone down their own armies with you, you can choose what army you want to get into. If you’re more of a money-oriented kind of person, I would steer away from Horde style factions, such as the Imperial Guard, Orks, and Tyranids. The best armies to start off with here would be Harlequins and Custodes. They require very few models in their armies, and they’re pretty solid overall. However if these do not suit your fancy, I would recommend looking on EBay for models. Most of the time they will come painted, so you might have a batch of mixed models making up your entire army. If you’re worried about gameplay, the Space Marines are the most well rounded faction despite their overwhelming model roster. Get some basic squads of space marines, with some devastators and assault squads for a well rounded infantry list. If you want a vehicle, you can’t go wrong with a Rhino or a Predator. From there, you can expand out your list depending on how you enjoy playing; you can get Primaris Intercessors for a stronger frontline, Bladeguard Veterans for a melee focused infantry unit, or Primaris Aggressors for some heavy infantry fire support. There’s tons of ways to expand out your army from there!</p>
                                <p>If you know what kind of playstyle you enjoy, I have some recommendations as well. If you prefer ranged combat, the Astra Militarum (aka Imperial Guard) or Tau are the best choices for you. The Guard focuses on quantity over quality with some great artillery and tanks, while the Tau feature some heavy hitting firepower and mechs. If you like melee, Orks, Tyranids, and Drukhari and the way to go. The first two are more horde style, so if you want to save on money, the Dark Eldar (basically just Dark Elves) are the best choice for you. The Tyranids can be more focused and specialized than the Orks, but nobody can hate the Orks because of their fun mechanics and lore! Want a fast and maneuverable team? Craftworld Eldar or Harlequins. Want a tanky team? Necrons or Death Guard. Want a spellcasting team? Craftworld Eldar or Thousand Sons. There are plenty of playstyles to choose from!</p>
                                <p>With that, I think I’m finally done explaining Warhammer 40k to you. I didn’t cover the rules and gameplay, nor the factions themselves. The best way to learn the game is to play with friends and meet some new people! With that concluded, I wish you all luck in your games. May the dice gods favor you!</p>
