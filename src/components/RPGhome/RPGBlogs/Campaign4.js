                                <p><b>Chapter 4 Time to Punch the Cult in the Faces</b></p>
                                <p>After resting from the troglodyte battle, it is decided that the Golden Grain Inn, which is basically across the street from where they are holed up should be the first target to be assaulted.  Morgrym has a score to settle with the Inn and the group would be glad to see one hive of cultist activity destroyed.  Knowing that the cultists take people away, only for them to return eventually, it’s decided that Morgrym and Logan should enter the bar alone, leaving Mireth and Honri hiding in the jail house waiting for a signal to attack.</p>
                                <p>Morgrym and Logan head inside the Golden Grain. There are several farmers drinking and eating their dinners. The bartender, Bertram, looks surprised to see Morgrym, but the cultist hand signal is provided which throws him off a little bit. Logan and Morgrym approach the bar with much suspicion while Logan exclaims that he was just recently converted, this tips off the barkeep and he yells, ‘Take ‘em boys!’ while he ducks behind the bar.  The farmhands all stand up and begin to approach and surround the two adventurers.  Not wanting to let the barkeep escape, Morgrym says ‘Burn in the light of Pholtus’, shooting flames from his hands and setting the alcohol on the bar top on fire while he jumps up onto the bar, and continues his burning down onto the unsuspecting barkeep. Logan quickly draws his sword facing off against 5 foes. The commotion is heard across the street by Mireth and Honri who quickly race across to join into the fray.</p>
                                <p>Logan manages to drop 2 of the farmhands with deft strikes of his new sword, but then feels something prick him in the neck.  Reaching up, he pulls out a dart.  Things start to go black, and Logan tries to get to the door.  Morgrym leaps down from the bar, smashing into a farmhand, knocking him unconscious, leaving one individual still standing, a human dressed in leathers with a scar down his face, pulling out another dart, but decides that it would be best to deal with Morgrym using his blade and unsheathes a short sword.  He grins at Morgrym and causes some unsteadiness in the stout dwarf. Honri and Mireth arrive in time to see Logan collapse through the doorway. Mireth tends to Logan while Honri enters to assist Morgrym.</p>
                                <p>Mireth pours a healing potion into Logan and heads inside, only to find that Honri is unable to hit the human rogue who appears to have several magical defenses. Morgrym is also unable to hit him with his mace and has suffered several cuts from the rogue’s blade. Mireth looks around for something to help and sees a chandelier hanging from a rope right over the rogue. He unleashes two magic missiles into the rope while Honri follows suit with magic missiles of his own. This causes the chandelier to come crashing down and knocking the rogue unconscious. The group quickly subdues him and proceeds to put out the fire that has engulfed the bar. A search of the combatants reveals that the bartender had a magical dagger, the farmhands only had normal weapons, but the rogue, Derek Desleigh, is loaded with magical items (magic leather armor, magic rings, magic darts, and a magic short bow).  Morgrym and a now recovered Logan decide to take Derek to a private room and ‘interrogate’ him while Honri and Mireth continue to search the bar for clues.</p>
                                <p>Morgrym applies an old dwarven method of making sure that spellcasters can no longer function by managing to pull two teeth from the rogue before he awakens, screaming.  He manages to tell Logan and Morgrym that he’s just a hired assassin to provide muscle for the cult, but honestly the only reason that he’s staying in this shithole town is that he’s sleeping with Misha Devi, the acolyte at the temple of Merika and that he is supposed to meet her later that night for a romantic encounter.  Derek pleads for his life saying that all he wants to do is return to Hookhill.  All of Derek’s magical equipment is removed and while he is still tied up, Logan leads him to the edge of town and tells him that if he ever sees his face again, Logan will kill him.</p>
                                <p>Even though the group is depleted, it’s decided that the encounter with Misha is too good to pass up. Logan dresses up in Derek’s gear, giving him huge magical bonuses to defense and the group is going to try to have his pose as Derek for the encounter and surprise her, trying to capture her.</p>
