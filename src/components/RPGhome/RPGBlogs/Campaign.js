                                <p>Chapter 2 Unwelcome to Orlane:</p>
                                <p>The group, now four strong traveled through the Dim Forest and out into the fields just to the south of the woods. Early on the fourth afternoon, a cluster of buildings and trees becomes visible, with the stone walls of a temple beyond – Orlane. At the outskirts of Orlane, a large grove of elms is visible to the left, while several wooden buildings border the toad to the right. Passing some of the buildings near the entrance, people tended to watch with suspicion or pull their children inside at the group of mostly demi-humans.</p>
                                <p>At the first crossroad in the town, the group is met by the local constable, Grover. He interrogates the group as to their business and informs the group that the mayor is unavailable for business. An argument breaks out between Grover and Mireth about the delivery of the letter from Hochoch with Grover reluctantly agreeing to go check with the mayor if he will see the party. With Grover out of sight, the group quickly decides that it’s best to not be around when he returns and heads off into the town to find a place to stay. </p>
                                <p>They first come across a dairy farmer, Nowell, where Morgrym purchases a supply of his new favorite exotic drink, butter milk. The group gets a little information from the farmer about the local inns and proceeds to the closest one, the Golden Grain Inn. The place isn’t in the best of repair with peeling paint and faded decorations. Morgrym heads inside, but the elves don’t set foot inside as this place is below their standards. The elves, along with Logan, head off to the north towards the only other Inn in the town, the Slumbering Serpent. The innkeepers, Belba and Ollwin greet the group with a friendly wave and invite them inside. Rooms are purchased for the evening and the group discuss matters with Belba about the strange goings on in the town. </p>
                                <p>She tells the group about people disappearing, then reappearing, somehow altered and not nearly as friendly. She tells of the temple of Merika and how the high priest hasn’t been seen in several weeks, and a new Acolyte has taken over all religious functions.  Her name is Misha Devi.  She also gives a rundown of the local farmers nearby and various local gossip in the area while the group listens in over dinner. Once they have a bead on the local gossip, the group decides that it’s best to check in the Morgrym since he hasn’t been seen for a few hours. They head back towards the Golden Grain but find no evidence of their Dwarven companion and the bar keep insists he has never seen a dwarf. This puts them near the constable and the group is accosted once again.  Another argument breaks out and the group is arrested for disturbing the peace – well, disturbing Grover’s peace mainly, but he is the town law.</p>
                                <p>The group languishes in a jail cell for a day, then the next night, they are taken from their cells by Grover, 2 deputies and a red robed individual. They are escorted outside where they can see a jail cell attached to a wagon, another red robed driver and a slumped over, unconscious dwarf lying in the cage.  Another argument breaks out between Grover and Mireth while Logan tries to free himself, fails, then sets off running with a deputy chasing after him.  Mireth casts sleep, knocking Grover and the other deputy unconscious, but the 2 red robed cultists are very much in fighting shape. Honri runs over and leaps onto the wagon, while the driver quickly whips the horse into action, causing it to head down the road. Logan and the deputy get into a wrestling match with Logan quickly choking out the deputy using his manacles. Meanwhile, Mireth managed to tackle the cultist by him, but was losing the fight as the cultist had a dagger. The battle was saved when Logan arrived and kicked the cultist into unconsciousness. With the wagon now speeding down the road, Honri managed to climb to the top of the cage, maneuver is way to the front, then with a swinging kick, landed on the seat of the wagon, knocking the cultist off the wagon, breaking his neck on the ground.</p>
                                <p>Logan and Mireth managed to get the keys from Grover for their manacles, freeing themselves. They then locked up the constable, deputy, and cultist in the jail cells. By the time that Honri returned with the dead cultist and the wagon, the street was mostly cleared up of the incident and the group hid the wagon behind the jailhouse. Morgrym was awakened and it is revealed that he was bushwhacked inside the bar after being drugged with a free drink. Another half-elf and a human are inside other cells. They are released on condition that they help figure out what’s going on with the cultists. Ambrose the half-elven druid and Kobata a human wrestler/entertainer quickly joins up with the group mainly so that they can get out of jail time. The group decided to hole up in the jailhouse till morning and then work out a plan.</p>

                                <p>The band of lost adventurers:</p>
                                <p>It was a worrisome day in the woodland village of Hochoch.  The mayor had sent a band of farmers out with the yearly crop tribute over a week ago and they were late in returning.  Not only were the farmhands needed to tend to the remaining crops, but the carts that they travelled with would be needed to help bring in the remainder of the crops for the winter.  Mayor Willheim put out a notice for anyone to come to his aide and go looking for the lost wagon caravan and find out what happened to his people and the tribute crop that was due in Hookhill.  The ones that answered his request for help were not what he was expecting.  </p>
                                <p>There was a dwarven priest of Pholtus, Morgrym Sunspeaker, an elven diplomat’s nephew with a long rambling title, Mireth Elajor and a half-elven minstrel named Henri Descateaux.</p>
                                <p>Now, demi-humans were not common in Hochoch, elves moreso than dwarves which were rare, but Willheim was desperate.  The crops in the fields needed to be reaped and brought in for storage or they would spoil and the farmhands would be needed along with the carts.  He offered the group a small sum of money to track the caravan and bring back whatever they could find.  The three adventurers set out almost immediately after gathering up some pastries and moonshine from local merchants and set out into the Dim Forest woods along the trade route to Hookhill.</p>
                                <p>The group travelled southeast for two days before noticing that there were wagon tracks which led off into the woods on the southern side of the road.  Deciding to check out the tracks, they headed deeper into the woods until they came across the Javan River.  Finding a crossing point, just as darkness was coming, they decided to set up camp.  As the group was about to head off to sleep, some noise was heard up a nearby hill.  Mireth and Henri set off scouting up the hill to see what was transpiring.  They were able to see a goblin campsite, where a wagon and a fairly smashed wagon were present, along with a cave leading into the hillside.  There were a few goblins dancing around a campfire, cooking what looked like a horse or mule on the fire.  The group gathered back together and decided on a plan.</p>
                                <p>Since Morgrym was not very stealthy, Mireth would cast an enlarge spell on him so that when he came crashing through the woods, he would be a giant-sized dwarf.  Meanwhile, Mireth and Henri would sweep around to opposite sides to try and encircle the goblins.  Once the group was set, Morgrym came crashing up the hill and into the clearing, startling the goblins, putting them on the defensive, it's not often that a giant dwarf comes crashing through the woods with a mace and shield screaming at you.  Henri shot one with his short bow, striking it in the ribs, killing it instantly.  Mireth threw a dart at another, striking it but not for much damage, causing it to retreat into the cave.  The remaining two goblins moved towards Morgrym, trying to flank him.</p>
                                <p>Henri shot one of the two goblins fighting Morgrym in the back, killing another, while Morgrym battled with the remaining goblin.  Mireth noticed that something was crawling out of the cave, trying to hide among some debris.  As Morgrym dispatched the last remaining goblin with his mace, a roar could be heard from the cave as an ogre and 2 more goblins emerged, looking around angrily and finding Morgrym on the opposite side of the fire standing over two of their dead comrades.</p>
                                <p>Mireth snuck up behind the broken cart, trying to get closer to whatever moved out of the cave while Henri moved back to a flanking position to get in additional bow shots.  Morgrym stood in the firelight and challenged the ogre, but made sure to keep the fire between them as he was a little wounded and did not want to face an additional three enemies by himself.  He prayed for Pholtus' light to heal him a little, but kept himself well out of range of the enemies.</p>
                                <p>That is when the crawling figure reached out and grabbed one of the goblins, pulling him down into a wrestling match.  Henri fired at the Ogre, hitting it and just making it more mad as it charged towards Morgrym right through the fire, kicking the wood and flames all around the area, catching the carts on fire.  Morgrym moved around to the front of the good cart and tried to dump the firey grain over onto the Ogre, but he couldn't lift the entire cart.  The Ogre then started smashing his way through the cart.  Henri killed the other goblin, which was trying to flank around Morgrym with another arrow shot to the body.  Meanwhile, Mireth found that a human captive, badly injured, was fighting with the last remaing goblin.  Mireth helped him dispatch the goblin, then started working on freeing him from his bonds.</p>
                                <p>Once the human prisoner was freed, Mireth gave him his dagger and the human ran toward the ogre from behind, striking it in the back.  The ogre roared in rage and backhanded him, sending him into a heap on the ground, blood pouring from his mouth as his head struck the ground.  Henri fired another shot into the Ogre's chest while Morgrym moved to engage the creature.  Morgrym could not find a good purchase with his mace and took a nasty punch which knocked him back several feet, wounding him further.  Henri continued to pepper the Ogre with arrows while Mireth ran up and pulled the human from combat, starting to tend to his wounds.  He was not a medic mind you, but he started wrapping him in bandages where he could see blood coming out.</p>
                                <p>With both carts now fully enflamed, the campsite was a mess.  Morgrym was trying to keep the ogre at bay, fighting defensively while Henri continued to strike the creature with arrows, finally felling the creature with a shot right to its heart, dropping it almost on top of Morgrym, who slumped over in pain and injury, calling on Pholtus to once again heal himself.  With the adversaries defeated, the group took inventory of what was around.  Neither wagon was salvageable, the pack animals had all been eaten and the farmhands were all dead (a noticeable pile of human bones in the cave was a dead giveaway).  The human that was saved was healed by Morgrym back into consciousness.  He said that his name was Logan and he was a hired guide leading the group back from Hookhill when they were ambushed.  The group was able to deliver the crops to Hookhill, so the yearly tribute had been paid.  Logan was able to recover his gear from the cave along with some coins and clothing and items from the dead farmhands.  The metal parts from the wagons were recovered so that the group could prove what had happened.</p>
                                <p>The group returned to Hochoch with Logan in tow and informed the mayor of what happened.  Willheim was distraught over the complete loss of life and the wagons which were vital to the economy of the village.  The group presented him with what they had and even gave him most of the coins that were captured in the cave.  Mayor Willheim said that it would be best for us to leave the village and not inform the others of the loss.  He said that his friend the Mayor or Orlane needed some help and wrote the group a letter introducing the party to him.  He said to only give it to the mayor.  Mireth took the letter and the group headed off back into the Dim Forrest towards the farming village or Orlane.  Logan decided to join the group as he was headed back in the same direction.</p>
