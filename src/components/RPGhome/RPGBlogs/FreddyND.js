                                <p>It’s Saturday. Time to get Spooky!</p>
                                <p>Our pick this week is Jason, the hockey mask wearing momma’s boy from the Friday the 13th franchise.</p>
                                <p>Jason is indestructible. That’s his whole schtick. He basically regenerates all damage and tanks stab wounds like a champ, all while chopping down horny teenagers like stalks of wheat. Because of this, Jason is a lot simpler than Freddy. A mass murderer with a machete doesn’t need any mystical powers, he just needs to kill you.</p>
                                <h4><ins>Ability Breakdown</ins></h4>
                                <p>Look, I’m just gonna come out and say it: Jason is a tanky mofo. This man has survived fourteen movies having been stabbed, drowned, hit with an axe, and generally abused. His longevity is thanks in large part to his wicked cool regenerative skills, a la the Wolverine, and Hollywood’s complete lack of originality. In this 5e interpretation, not only does Jason have a ton of resistances, but he also regains 2d12 hit points at the start of every round. When combined with his 300hp, and +7 constitution modifier, Jason is guaranteed to shrug off a good portion of what your party is trying to do to him. Oh, you stabbed him? That’s cool bro, but he takes half damage, and he’s gonna close that wound up next time his turn comes around. What’s this? You hit him with a mace? Tis but a flesh wound homie, he’s fine.</p>
                                <p>Even better, while you recoil in horror as his bones snap back into place, he’s gonna grab you. And with a +21 athletics score, you are going to get grabbed. Then he will stab you. A lot. I mean, a lot a lot. Sure, his machete doesn’t do a ton of damage, but the man is not going to let go of you without some serious divine intervention. You’re gonna have to nat 20, or pray. Honestly, probably both! And the whole time you're waiting for the dice gods to answer your prayers, he’s going to be inflicting some serious hurt onto you. He gets advantage with his machete, and does 2d6+6 bonus damage! Squishies beware.</p>
                                <br />                               
                                <p>To make the whole experience even worse, I would 100% make your characters underleveled. The more astute observers may have noticed that he has no real defense against magic. Your best bet is to sit back from range and just hurl spells at him. Let’s be real, we play D&D. Fireball cures all ills.  Keep in mind, while he is a mass murdering giant, technically most of his iterations have him as just being a man. A man who feels no pain, sure, but still just a man. So there isn’t reallyyyyy a good reason for him to be immune to magic (Unless you want to talk about how Adam Marcus made him a Deadite, but then we get into a copyright debate, and whether or not that’s canon, and these posts are supposed to be snappy, so let's not). However, if your party has no decent spells, and your cleric already used their cure wounds to fix up that rather nasty stab wound… welp. Looks like it's time to run. Quickly. Away. Tell your mum to come get you from summer camp, because the hockey mask wearing psycho has already chopped your mates to bits, and you’re next.</p>

                                <div className="byline">Ryan Aspinall October 16th, 2021</div>
                                <p>Our first Villain for Spooky Saturdays is an all time classic, Freddy Kreuger!</p>
                                <p>This build is based purely on the first movie. The deeper you delve into the Cravenverse, the more insane and complicated things get. I could write literally a dozen different versions of this character, and still not cover every variation. The focus for this build is the idea that he cannot be stopped.</p>
                                <h4><ins>The Dreamscape</ins></h4>
                                <p>Freddy Kreuger is a dream demon, and as such is going to get all kinds of nifty bonuses when inside of people’s minds. He also innately has the ability to bring any sleeping PCs directly into his Region, the Dreamscape. Once inside, your PCs should probably get ready for some serious terror. Freddy can teleport, walk through doors, and is unable to be permanently killed while inside the Dreamscape. Plus, as it is all a dream (it always was, ehgads!), the setting is entirely up to you!</p>
                                <p>Perhaps you want to recreate the movie, and have the action take place inside of Nancy’s house, or the boiler room below the highschool. Maybe a spooky haunted house by the lake? Or in the woods? Or… actually, pretty much any kind of haunted house should suit you. Go wild!</p>
                                <br />
                                <h4><ins>Ability Breakdown</ins></h4>
                                <p>Let’s look at his abilities! As you can probably tell, the names of his actions and abilities are directly inspired by his creepy nursery rhyme. The Legendary Action Freddy’s Coming for You is really the bread and butter of his kit. The ability to teleport towards any character and instantly inflict damage is supposed to be a surprise, and any DM should avoid telling their players what’s going on. It’s also a great way to get closer to those pesky backliners, and make them feel pressured. Freddy can then either use his claws, stabbing players, or use his longer ranged Elm Street Slasher as they try to run away. Elm Street Slasher is open to interpretation of how he does it. One way is to think of him launching out condensed aura and slicing PCs. Maybe he rips a hole in reality and his claws reach that far. Or, perhaps he has extendo arms that reach all 20 feet. Whatever you decide, make it scary!
                                    Aside from dealing damage, Freddy is a bit of an unstoppable force. Literally. There are no means by which to stop him. Better Lock the Door is supposed to be an overpowered ability, and prevent players from simply casting spells from afar, or impeding his movement. However, it should not be abused. You can use this ability to sneak up on players, hitting them quick with a teleport, or a volley of Elm Street Slasher, and then get out again. A one on one confrontation doesn’t need to be the only way to deal with him. An unstoppable demon who only shows up occasionally to inflict serious damage and then leaves can be much worse than one who shows up, TPKs, and then gloats over you players poor poor desiccated corpses. Plus, even if they do kill him, he’ll be back in a few days thanks to Never Sleep Again, a pesky little thing that makes him effectively immortal inside the Dreamscape.</p>
                                <p>Which begs the question, how do you kill him? Well, that’s up to you! Magical artifacts, different objectives to complete, or finding the source of his evil are all options. Maybe there’s a pseudo holy grail inside the house that can banish him for a longer period of time. The vicar down the street seems to know something, why don’t you go talk to him? Bring coffee though, you’d hate to go into the Dreamscape alone. Because don’t you know?</p>
                                <p>Freddy’s Coming for you...</p>
