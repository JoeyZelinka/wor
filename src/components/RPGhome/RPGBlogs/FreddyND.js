                                <p>It’s the place for all things RPG here at World of Realms! Written by Ryan (hey hello it’s me) our resident RPG enthusiast, Natty Dubs will consist of original content as well as stories and news from around the RPG-verse. </p>
                                <p>For the month of October, come by every Saturday for Spooky Saturdays, where we will be creating a new monster for D&D fifth edition based on classic movie monsters and villains!</p>

                                <h2>Spooky Saturday's: Freddy Kreuger Edition</h2>
                                <div className="byline">Ryan Aspinall October 16th, 2021</div>
                                <p>Our first Villain for Spooky Saturdays is an all time classic, Freddy Kreuger!</p>
                                <p>This build is based purely on the first movie. The deeper you delve into the Cravenverse, the more insane and complicated things get. I could write literally a dozen different versions of this character, and still not cover every variation. The focus for this build is the idea that he cannot be stopped.</p>
                                <h4><ins>The Dreamscape</ins></h4>
                                <p>Freddy Kreuger is a dream demon, and as such is going to get all kinds of nifty bonuses when inside of people’s minds. He also innately has the ability to bring any sleeping PCs directly into his Region, the Dreamscape. Once inside, your PCs should probably get ready for some serious terror. Freddy can teleport, walk through doors, and is unable to be permanently killed while inside the Dreamscape. Plus, as it is all a dream (it always was, ehgads!), the setting is entirely up to you!</p>
                                <p>Perhaps you want to recreate the movie, and have the action take place inside of Nancy’s house, or the boiler room below the highschool. Maybe a spooky haunted house by the lake? Or in the woods? Or… actually, pretty much any kind of haunted house should suit you. Go wild!</p>
                                <br/>
                                <h4><ins>Ability Breakdown</ins></h4>
                                <p>Let’s look at his abilities! As you can probably tell, the names of his actions and abilities are directly inspired by his creepy nursery rhyme. The Legendary Action Freddy’s Coming for You is really the bread and butter of his kit. The ability to teleport towards any character and instantly inflict damage is supposed to be a surprise, and any DM should avoid telling their players what’s going on. It’s also a great way to get closer to those pesky backliners, and make them feel pressured. Freddy can then either use his claws, stabbing players, or use his longer ranged Elm Street Slasher as they try to run away. Elm Street Slasher is open to interpretation of how he does it. One way is to think of him launching out condensed aura and slicing PCs. Maybe he rips a hole in reality and his claws reach that far. Or, perhaps he has extendo arms that reach all 20 feet. Whatever you decide, make it scary!
Aside from dealing damage, Freddy is a bit of an unstoppable force. Literally. There are no means by which to stop him. Better Lock the Door is supposed to be an overpowered ability, and prevent players from simply casting spells from afar, or impeding his movement. However, it should not be abused. You can use this ability to sneak up on players, hitting them quick with a teleport, or a volley of Elm Street Slasher, and then get out again. A one on one confrontation doesn’t need to be the only way to deal with him. An unstoppable demon who only shows up occasionally to inflict serious damage and then leaves can be much worse than one who shows up, TPKs, and then gloats over you players poor poor desiccated corpses. Plus, even if they do kill him, he’ll be back in a few days thanks to Never Sleep Again, a pesky little thing that makes him effectively immortal inside the Dreamscape.</p>
                                <p>Which begs the question, how do you kill him? Well, that’s up to you! Magical artifacts, different objectives to complete, or finding the source of his evil are all options. Maybe there’s a pseudo holy grail inside the house that can banish him for a longer period of time. The vicar down the street seems to know something, why don’t you go talk to him? Bring coffee though, you’d hate to go into the Dreamscape alone. Because don’t you know?</p>
                                <p>Freddy’s Coming for you...</p>
