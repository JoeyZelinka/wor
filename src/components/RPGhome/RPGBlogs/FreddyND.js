                                <div className="byline">Ryan Aspinall October 30th, 2021</div>
                                <p>It's the night of All Hallows Eve, and you and your fellow party members have settled in after a long night spent trick or treating. A fierce storm rages outside, and the warmth of the lit hearth is valiantly overpowering the chill of the night. Your tiefling warlock perks up suddenly. They’ve just received a psychic message from their patron: the results of their heritage test are in! Finally, they can rest easy with their tragic backstory having finally been solved! Their father, it turns out, is a pit fiend by the name of Bal-Alren. Their mother, a woman named… Laurie Strode? Hm, that doesn’t sound right. You look around, befuddlement on the faces of all your friends. None of you have ever heard that kind of name before. For some reason, it just doesn’t seem to fit… Suddenly, there’s a sound at the door of your cabin. <b>Thump, thump, thump.</b> Who could be knocking at this time of night, all the way out in the woods?</p>
                                <p>“I’ll get it!” The bright and cheery wood-elf ranger bounces over and starts to open the door. A chill runs down your spine.</p>
                                <p>“No, wait!” You cry out, but it’s too late. The fire extinguishes with a woosh as the rain and wind come screaming into the room. The ranger turns around, holding her hands to her neck, blood gushing out from between her fingers. Behind her, illuminated by a sudden flash of lightning is a massive man, a bloody knife raised high above his head. A mask adorns his face, and he makes no sound as he steps into the room, his eyes now fixed on your tiefling friend, who is backing away in terror…</p>
                                <img src="myers.jpg" alt=""></img>
                                <p>The final chapter of Spooky Saturday is the Halloween classic, Michael Myers. Continuing with last week’s theme of masked psychotic murderers, this villain is fairly similar to Jason Vorhees. However, whereas Jason kills indiscriminately, Michael is fixated on one character in particular: Laurie Strode.</p>
                                <p>Whether you think that he is related to her, or that Paul Rudd is right and it’s some kind of ancient drucidc curse, Myers has been hunting this woman for the past 40 years of cinema. Strangely, it seems like one of your party members has some far flung relation to her, and he’s coming for them next.</p>
                                <p>Michael’s whole kit is based around killing the one member of the party he deems to be connected. Think of it like a Ranger’s favored enemy, just a lot more violent and bloody! The DM will choose which player will be afflicted by Strode Fixation, either by lottery or spitefulness. That player is now the most important player of the session, as Michael will prioritize their death above all others. They are in the most danger. Conversely, this player is also the only one capable of actually killing him! To pay homage to the first film however, he won't die of bullets, nor will any kind of incendiary damage take him down. A good beheading will most likely be your best bet, but it remains to be seen if that is feasible. He can use his Psycho Killer ability to knock you down, and deal two swift shanks with his Kitchen Knife. If you try to run away, Stalker allows him to close the distance, making him much faster than the majority of characters.</p>
                                <p>Whereas Jason and Freddy are more able to be fought like standard D&D monsters, Michael is going to take more strategy. Your party is going to be limited in both how much damage they can deal to him, and how difficult it might be for the session's protagonist to deal the killing blow. Keep in mind, if you miss, he’s going to turn around and absolutely merc them, easily dishing out insane damage. It’s a game of cat and mouse, and unfortunately, your party is going to be the mouse.</p>
                                <p>Good luck to you! If you manage to pull it off, kudos for now. But be aware, a reboot is just around the corner. If you start to hear that creepy piano fill… take a DNA test. If you’re related to anyone named Laurie. Just run.</p>

                <h2>Commander Farsight: A 40K + D&D Mashup</h2>
                <div className="byline">Ryan Aspinall October 29th, 2021</div>
                <img src="Farsight4.jpg" alt=""></img>
                <p>Crossovers appear to be on everyone’s mind recently. I have an article coming out next week about the Wizards of the Coast mashing D&D together with Magic the Gathering. They’ve put dungeons on the damn board. It’s wild. In light of that, I’ve decided to smash together two more deeply nerdy things: 40k and D&D. Who better to start with than the leader of the Fire Caste Tau, Commander Farisght?</p>
                <p>For those of you who don’t know, Commander Farsight is by far the most badass of all the Tau warriors. Farsight is also a strategic genius. HIs name comes from prescient knowledge of what an enemy is going to do. He sees into the future. He has sight. That goes far. Farsight. It works. Unlike riptides surrounded by 40 shield drones (because 8th edition Tau are bull$%#t), Farsight is a Tau with spice. He hasa sword. Yes, a melee weapon is being used by a 40k race known almost exclusively for their obnoxious firing lines and ability to shoot overwatch every bloody turn. And you know what? He swings. He beat the hell out of my Space Wolf Chieftain in a 1v1, and I’ve never forgotten it. Between the baller suit of XV-8 armor giving him flight and advanced targeting capabilities, and his special weapon the “Dawn Blade” giving him prolonged life and vigor, Farsight is a force to be reckoned with.</p>
                <p> This build is going to give you the opportunity to use Farsight as a vicious force to absolutely decimate your players. Also, it’s gonna be mostly homebrewed content. Some of the abilities will be taken from Warhammer as well, so if there are any space commies in the chat, hullo space komrad.</p>
                <h4><ins>Ability Breakdown</ins></h4>
                <p>As previously stated, Farsight is a military genius. He’s a grey skinned, four fingered Sun Tzu who made his name slaying legions of orcs. His ability, Precognition, reflects this, giving him a significant bonus to his initiative, and preventing him from being surprised. You just assume he knows what you're going to do before you do it. If you’re an orc, not only does he know you’re coming, but he has spent years building a repository of information on how to kill you more efficiently. Orc Slayer of Aruknasha gives Farsight almost guaranteed hits, as well as insane damage against orcs. Feel free to let your party know not to play a half orc. Or don’t. Lastly, Farsight’s ability For the Greater Good ports the Tau overwatch mechanic over to D&D. Commander Farsight’s allies are going to get an extra attack in combat. This ability is going to give the overall encounter a bit more danger, as your PCs could come under a ridiculous amount of fire any time Farsight feels like. Even with all his allies rolling at disadvantage, that damage could wrack up quickly!</p>
                <p>His XV-8 Battlesuit has a few benefits as well. <b>Hardwired Target Lock</b> is a great way for Farsight to almost guarantee a hit on an opponent, as well as helping his allies deal some much needed chip damage to opponents. His suit also  grants him a Flying speed of 40ft, which he can forgo by using his <b>Hover</b> ability, improving his already fantastic aim, and allowing him to ignore partial cover. He’s got the angles. If you're under the impression that a floating battlesuit is a solid choice to shoot at, you would be correct! It’s floating there, ripe for the taking. Charge up your lance and open fi- aaaaaaand shield drone. Nice.</p>
                <p><b>Push the Pain</b> is another fun ability that comes from 40k, and it allows Farsight to move the damage of an attack to one of his two shield drones at his side. They’re rather squishy, and a stiff breeze will make them burst into flames and composite. However, they absorb all of the damage. If you unloaded a massive spell at Farsight in an attempt to dent some armor, I can almost guarantee his drone buddies are gonna ruin it for you. Because Warham- I mean, D&D, is all about fun and balance! Hehe…</p>
                <p>Finally, we have the good stuff: Murder. Farsight canonically has access to a variety of weapons. For simplicity’s sake, he only has two here: the classic tau Plasma Rifle, and his iconic dawn blade. The Plasma Rifle is a long range power house, and it allows Farsight to smash opponents from quite a distance away. His Dawn Blade is really his bread and butter however. In addition to dealing an average of 30 damage a swing, it also allows Farsight to regenerate part of his hp on successful strikes. This can be incredibly useful when he is in close, and can allow him to continue fighting long past when he should realistically fall. Much like his lore, he is relentless in his pursuit.</p>
                <p>And that’s it! Thank you for reading the first of what will most likely be several 40k to D&D conversions. I am a massive fan of both games, and had the pleasure of reading all of the Farsight Lore books. For research. Because my life is awesome. And Joey is a dirty Tau player.</p>
                <p>My Space Wolves currently have a losing record against Joey, but that’s ok! Maybe if I’m lucky I can run a one shot where I destroy him with his own beloved Commander Farsight, the coolest Tau around.</p>

                <h2>Pirates: a D&D One Shot (5e)</h2>
                <div className="byline">Ryan Aspinall October 25th, 2021</div>
                <img src="pirate.png" alt=""></img>
                <p>I had a friend request my services as a DM recently. Their girlfriend wanted to play D&D for their birthday (excellent choice), and they asked me to create a one shot for around 7-8 people. When deciding upon a theme, my friend mentioned that they had recently watched the Pirates of the Carribean movies for the very first time.</p>
                <p>“There it is! Our theme!” I said. “Pirates!”</p>
                <p>Which really, is a great idea. Who hasn’t entertained fantasies of sailing around the high seas, plundering loot and fighting their rivals on the open water? There was just one problem: the official D&D ruleset did not have rules for ships! A quick perusal of the unofficial content led me to an Unearthed Arcana page, but I didn’t feel like it was what I was looking for. So, I did what DMs have been doing since the dawn of Role-playing games. I cracked my knuckles, buckled down, and created a brand new set of rules. Thus, the cleverly named Pirate System was born! Below is a full account of how to run this ruleset as a Dungeon Master (DM).</p>
                <p>The Pirate System requires several adjustments to work within the 5e rules. The first is the addition of three new skills: piloting, canon, and repair. The way these three skills are used will be fully explained in the next section. They correspond to how well you steer the ship, how well you fire cannons at other ships/ targets, and how well you repair damage to your own ship.  Before the session, I had players roll 3 d4s and then assign the rolls to the skills they wanted. Once complete, simply have players add a note on their character sheets with their selections.</p>
                <p>The next thing to consider is the ships themselves. Ships have a few values they absolutely need. Armor class, movement speed, and hit points are all essential. They allow the ship to engage in combat. These values, along with number of canons, number of crewmates, and the style of ship are all up to the DM or the players to decide. If you want a massive towering war dreadnought, make it have high AC and hitpoints. Arm that bad boy to the teeth and send it on its way. If your players want speed and maneuverability, perhaps a sloop is in order. This is one of those fun things that is entirely up to your discretion, and you can go as deep or shallow as you want with it.</p>
                <p>Now we move onto the most important part: how to have epic battles out on the open water. The system itself is fairly simple. Your playersand any accompanying NPCs on their ship make up the crew, and are considered “crewmates”. At the start of combat, every crewmate makes an initiative roll. The DM takes the average of these rolls to calculate the initiate score for the entire ship. Any other NPC ships make a single roll, adding whatever modifiers the DM wants. The highest scoring ship goes first, just like standard 5e rules.</p>
                <p>Once initiative is sorted, the system deviates from the norm. As opposed to having three actions each round (that being movement, action, then bonus action), crew members have the choice to take one OF three actions. Those are to Pilot, Fire Canon, or to Repair. These correspond to the new skills that you hopefully had your players roll at the start of the session! </p>
                <p>A round of combat plays out thusly: the DM will start with the first ship in the initiative order. Each crewmate will select one of three actions. Once every crewmate has selected which action they want to perform, actions resolve simultaneously! The ship will move, fire a salvo of cannon fire, and be repaired all at once. With larger parties (this system was originally run with 8 people), this keeps the combat simple and moving along. The specifics of how to perform each action are below.</p>
                <h4><ins>Piloting</ins></h4>
                <p>If the crew wants to move somewhere, one player will be designated as the Principal Navigator. The Principal Navigator will make a Piloting check, consisting of a D20 roll + their Piloting score. Other members of the party can aid the Principal Navigator (trimming sails, pulling out oars) as an action, thereby adding their individual Piloting skill to the overall Piloting check for that round.</p>
                <p>For instance, Player A has been selected as the Principal Navigator. They roll a D20, and get an 11 on the dice. If their piloting skill is a +3, the overall result of the Piloting check is  a 14. However, if Player B has decided to help them, and had a Piloting skill of +2, they would add that +2 to the original check to make the overall Piloting for that round a 16. It is at the discretion of the DM to decide what score is necessary to perform the movement.. If the crew wants to go in a straight line, a 16 should be more than sufficient. If they wanted to say, I don’t know, use a magically created whirlpool to attempt a slingshot (a la the Rich Purnell Maneuver from The Martian by Andy Weir) in order to ram an enemy ship, that would of course be much harder. The whole crew might have to pitch in to make that one work!</p>
                <h4><ins>Firing Cannons</ins></h4>
                <p>Oh yeah, the fun one. Canons are the bread and butter of ship based combat, and I can assure you that players will want to be firing them as much as possible. A ship can have any number of cannons, but every cannon will be the same. Each one has two firing modes, standard and grapeshot. Standard cannonballs deal 1d12+ Cannon skill damage, but suffer disadvantage at ranges beyond 120ft. Grapeshot, on the other hand, deals only 1d8 + Cannon skill damage, but is accurate out to 200ft. When a cremate chooses to fire a cannon, they first select which kind of cannonball to use and then make a ranged weapon attack using 1d20+ Cannon skill. </p>
                <p>Like Piloting, the success of the attack is up to the DM. A ship may only have an AC of 15, but environmental factors may compound to make it harder to hit. Consider, what’s the weather like? Is it a dark and stormy night? Is there a heavy fog? Are the seas roiling up and down, making it more difficult to time to volley? Is there an island you have to account for, which is obstructing an otherwise clear shot? These are all factors that should be considered when engaging in ship to ship combat.</p>
                <h4><ins>Repair</ins></h4>
                <p>As the crew’s ship suffers damage, different crewmates can choose to use their action to repair the ship. They roll 1d20 + Repair skill, and if the result is above a ten, they restore 1d10+ Repair skill hit points to the ship. I found this to be the most challenging yet rewarding process as a DM. It’s interesting to describe how the player’s go above repairing the ship. Maybe they are mending a ripped sail, or retying a thick tar-encrusted rope that has come loose. Perhaps they are trying to stop the main mast from listing dangerously over the side of the ship, or cutting it free when it ultimately goes so as to preserve the maneuverability of the craft. There are a lot of options for flavor here, so really dig into the imagination bank!</p>
                <p>And that’s all she wrote mateys! Terrible word choice, but appropriate in this instance. Everything in this ruleset is by no means set in stone, and is completely flexible based upon your own experiences and the desires of you or your party. Also, despite it working oh so beautifully in one-shot, it has yet to be rigorously tested in a full campaign setting! If you do find this useful, please let us know at any of our socials, or by dropping us an email via the address on our contact page.</p>
                <p>Until next time, go get those Dubs.</p>

                                <h2>Spooky Saturday's: Jason Vorhees Edition</h2>
                                <div className="byline">Ryan Aspinall October 23th, 2021</div>
                                <p>It’s Saturday. Time to get Spooky!</p>
                                <p>Our pick this week is Jason, the hockey mask wearing momma’s boy from the Friday the 13th franchise.</p>
                                <p>Jason is indestructible. That’s his whole schtick. He basically regenerates all damage and tanks stab wounds like a champ, all while chopping down horny teenagers like stalks of wheat. Because of this, Jason is a lot simpler than Freddy. A mass murderer with a machete doesn’t need any mystical powers, he just needs to kill you.</p>
                                <h4><ins>Ability Breakdown</ins></h4>
                                <p>Look, I’m just gonna come out and say it: Jason is a tanky mofo. This man has survived fourteen movies having been stabbed, drowned, hit with an axe, and generally abused. His longevity is thanks in large part to his wicked cool regenerative skills, a la the Wolverine, and Hollywood’s complete lack of originality. In this 5e interpretation, not only does Jason have a ton of resistances, but he also regains 2d12 hit points at the start of every round. When combined with his 300hp, and +7 constitution modifier, Jason is guaranteed to shrug off a good portion of what your party is trying to do to him. Oh, you stabbed him? That’s cool bro, but he takes half damage, and he’s gonna close that wound up next time his turn comes around. What’s this? You hit him with a mace? Tis but a flesh wound homie, he’s fine.</p>
                                <p>Even better, while you recoil in horror as his bones snap back into place, he’s gonna grab you. And with a +21 athletics score, you are going to get grabbed. Then he will stab you. A lot. I mean, a lot a lot. Sure, his machete doesn’t do a ton of damage, but the man is not going to let go of you without some serious divine intervention. You’re gonna have to nat 20, or pray. Honestly, probably both! And the whole time you're waiting for the dice gods to answer your prayers, he’s going to be inflicting some serious hurt onto you. He gets advantage with his machete, and does 2d6+6 bonus damage! Squishies beware.</p>
                                <br />                               
                                <p>To make the whole experience even worse, I would 100% make your characters underleveled. The more astute observers may have noticed that he has no real defense against magic. Your best bet is to sit back from range and just hurl spells at him. Let’s be real, we play D&D. Fireball cures all ills.  Keep in mind, while he is a mass murdering giant, technically most of his iterations have him as just being a man. A man who feels no pain, sure, but still just a man. So there isn’t reallyyyyy a good reason for him to be immune to magic (Unless you want to talk about how Adam Marcus made him a Deadite, but then we get into a copyright debate, and whether or not that’s canon, and these posts are supposed to be snappy, so let's not). However, if your party has no decent spells, and your cleric already used their cure wounds to fix up that rather nasty stab wound… welp. Looks like it's time to run. Quickly. Away. Tell your mum to come get you from summer camp, because the hockey mask wearing psycho has already chopped your mates to bits, and you’re next.</p>

                                <p>Our first Villain for Spooky Saturdays is an all time classic, Freddy Kreuger!</p>
                                <p>This build is based purely on the first movie. The deeper you delve into the Cravenverse, the more insane and complicated things get. I could write literally a dozen different versions of this character, and still not cover every variation. The focus for this build is the idea that he cannot be stopped.</p>
                                <h4><ins>The Dreamscape</ins></h4>
                                <p>Freddy Kreuger is a dream demon, and as such is going to get all kinds of nifty bonuses when inside of people’s minds. He also innately has the ability to bring any sleeping PCs directly into his Region, the Dreamscape. Once inside, your PCs should probably get ready for some serious terror. Freddy can teleport, walk through doors, and is unable to be permanently killed while inside the Dreamscape. Plus, as it is all a dream (it always was, ehgads!), the setting is entirely up to you!</p>
                                <p>Perhaps you want to recreate the movie, and have the action take place inside of Nancy’s house, or the boiler room below the highschool. Maybe a spooky haunted house by the lake? Or in the woods? Or… actually, pretty much any kind of haunted house should suit you. Go wild!</p>

                                <h4><ins>Ability Breakdown</ins></h4>
                                <p>Let’s look at his abilities! As you can probably tell, the names of his actions and abilities are directly inspired by his creepy nursery rhyme. The Legendary Action Freddy’s Coming for You is really the bread and butter of his kit. The ability to teleport towards any character and instantly inflict damage is supposed to be a surprise, and any DM should avoid telling their players what’s going on. It’s also a great way to get closer to those pesky backliners, and make them feel pressured. Freddy can then either use his claws, stabbing players, or use his longer ranged Elm Street Slasher as they try to run away. Elm Street Slasher is open to interpretation of how he does it. One way is to think of him launching out condensed aura and slicing PCs. Maybe he rips a hole in reality and his claws reach that far. Or, perhaps he has extendo arms that reach all 20 feet. Whatever you decide, make it scary!
                                    Aside from dealing damage, Freddy is a bit of an unstoppable force. Literally. There are no means by which to stop him. Better Lock the Door is supposed to be an overpowered ability, and prevent players from simply casting spells from afar, or impeding his movement. However, it should not be abused. You can use this ability to sneak up on players, hitting them quick with a teleport, or a volley of Elm Street Slasher, and then get out again. A one on one confrontation doesn’t need to be the only way to deal with him. An unstoppable demon who only shows up occasionally to inflict serious damage and then leaves can be much worse than one who shows up, TPKs, and then gloats over you players poor poor desiccated corpses. Plus, even if they do kill him, he’ll be back in a few days thanks to Never Sleep Again, a pesky little thing that makes him effectively immortal inside the Dreamscape.</p>
                                <p>Which begs the question, how do you kill him? Well, that’s up to you! Magical artifacts, different objectives to complete, or finding the source of his evil are all options. Maybe there’s a pseudo holy grail inside the house that can banish him for a longer period of time. The vicar down the street seems to know something, why don’t you go talk to him? Bring coffee though, you’d hate to go into the Dreamscape alone. Because don’t you know?</p>
                                <p>Freddy’s Coming for you...</p>
