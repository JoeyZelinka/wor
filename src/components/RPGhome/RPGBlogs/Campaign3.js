                                <p>In the morning, the group checks on their newly detained prisoners for interrogation, but find that during the night, they had bitten their tongues and died either choking on their own blood or from outright blood loss. There were five dead in the jail cells (Grover, 2 deputies and 2 cultists) and the group tried to work out a plan to rid themselves of the evidence of any wrongdoing, finally settling on waiting until nightfall and loading them onto the cart and taking them out into the wilderness and burying them.</p>
                                <p>With the day ahead of them, they went about trying to try and figure out more about the cultists and what strange happenings are going on in the town and finally, perhaps finally delivering the letter to the mayor (Yes, the group is glorified mail carriers). The group of 6 set out to the northern edge of the town and the druid, Ambrose wants to head into the grove of elms. This is where they find the shack of an elderly herbalist, Ramne, and Easterling human. After much discussion with him, the group manage to get out that he’s in the town in disguise, searching for his daughter, who was abducted by the cult. Much information about the cultists is gained, including a telltale sign that cultists use to identify themselves to each other. The group learns that the temple of Merika seems to be the headquarters of the cult. Ramne also says that his weasel, Whiskers has identified something strange at a building near the far end of town. He gives the group some healing potions.</p>
                                <p>The group sets out with Ramne in tow. He is elderly and very slow, but the group slows their pace so that he can explain what he has learned about each farmhouse as they pass it. They bypass the temple of Merika for now as that seems to be the center for cult activity, instead heading to the building that whiskers the ferret detected something foul at. The building is in poor shape, the doors and windows are boarded up. The roof has several gaping holes giving the general appearance of the place being long abandoned. A broken sign is found on the ground indicating that this used to be a bar called the Foaming Mug. The group breaks into the building, having Morgrym break down the door and they proceed to search the bar room, noticing that there is a foul smell coming from somewhere. Ambrose, Morgrym and Logan proceed to search for the source of the smell, while Honri searches the bar. Kobata and Mireth stand watch near the windows and door to see if anyone approaches.</p>
                                <p>A trap door is found in the corner of the bar, leading to a cellar. Morgrym smacks at it with his mace, unleashing a foul smell in the area, Logan and Ambrose immediately succumb to nausea and start retching on the floor. Morgrym, unaffected breaks the trap door open and a nasty lizard headed creature pokes a spear through the broken door, trying to stab at Morgrym.  Morgrym backs up, forcing the creature to come up into the room allowing the party members at range an opportunity to attack. The creature is quickly felled, and it slumps back down into the cellar leaving a coating of slime behind on the stairs as it falls back.</p>
                                <p>Hearing more commotion down in the cellar, Morgrym proceed down the stairs, with Logan, having recovered from his retching proceeding behind him. Honri heads over but succumbs to the foul smell along with Ambrose, unable to recover. Ramne steels himself from the smell and heads down behind Logan. Kobata and Mireth continue to keep watch.</p>
                                <p>Morgrym finds a wine cellar at the bottom of the stairs and carefully steps over the dead body of the troglodyte. Logan slips on the slime and falls into the body, puncturing it and releasing even more foul smells and coating his armor in some kind of acid that was inside the body. A stone hand axe is thrown towards the group and strikes Ramne, dropping him instantly, falling on top of logan and the troglodyte. Three more troglodytes come out of the darkness to engage Morgrym. Kobata starts to descend the stairs, notices the log jam at the bottom and using his wrestling skills, leaps out over Morgrym and body tackles two of the troglodytes in a spectacular move landing on top of them.  Mireth manages to make his way over an stick his down into the basement, putting one of the prone troglodytes to sleep, allowing Kobata to focus on one.  Morgrym battles back and forth with a trog while Logan struggles to get Ramne’s limp body off him, but then proceeds to flank Morgrym’s foe allowing the two of them to finish the creature off quickly.  Honri manages a bow shot to help finish off Kobata’s foe and the group is left with 4 more dead bodies: 3 trogs and a now deceased Ramne, who’s dying words were for the group to rescue his daughter.</p>
                                <p>The group quickly searches the cellar, finding some kegs of wine that are still in a serviceable order. Mireth searches the bar once again, finding the cash box left over from the previous occupants and a good sum of money is recovered. The group decides to come back later in the evening with the wagon to recover these bodies as well for disposal. The group sneak out the back of the building and over to the lake where they proceed to wash off the foul stench and slime from the troglodytes. Logan finds that his armor has been eaten away by the slime and drops his chainmail before it starts to affect his skin. </p>
                                <p>Once cleaned up, the group splits up with Ambrose and Kobata deciding to part ways, and they head east out of town. The remaining party members (Logan, Mireth, Honri and Morgrym) decide that it is best to confront the mayor about the goings on in his town and see if he’s willing to help.  It is around mid-day when the group approaches the mayor residence, passing several shops and getting evil glares from the shopkeepers. They approach the mayor house and knock several times before someone answers and ushers them inside.  Mayor Zakarias Ormond is trying to be discreet and doesn’t want nosey neighbors to know that he is conversing with the group especially when they confront him with the cult activity in his town.  Zakarias offers to hire the group to root out the problem and help save his town, understanding that several of the townsfolk may have been corrupted by the cult.  He is saddened to hear of the loss of Ramne, but stresses that the town of Orlane is worth saving and pleads with the group for help, even offering up his personal sword to logan and his dead wife’s spell book for Mireth.  However, he says that he cannot directly interfere with any operations that the group does.  He wants to keep himself prepared to protect the town.</p>
                                <p>The group return to the jail house to plan for what they want to do.</p>
