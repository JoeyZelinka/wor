                        <div className="byline">By Mr. L November 3rd, 2021</div>
                        <p>I’ve been playing role playing games for over 40 years.  Starting with Basic D&D, then Advanced D&D, then Advanced D&D 2.0, then D&D 3.0 and D&D 3.5, we also played some Marvel.  Those games took me to college, where I got introduced to a new gaming group and new games.  Rolemaster, Heroes Unlimited and Champions were the winners for those years.</p>
                        <p>I was a dungeon master at around 12 with friends.  Even back then, I would enjoy making characters, building dungeons and worlds, playing them by myself when no one else was available, (This was during those satanic years, so public gameplay was not popular), or finding a select group of friends to play with.  This typically involved a sleepover and you would play late into the nights.  During high school, I found a regular gaming group and we would play most weekends, after work for some, or on Saturdays if everyone was available</p>
                        <p>During these times, I would learn many DMing skills that I still utilize today: if a character does something stupid, let them die; Never let a PC die on a night when they are not there; playtesting an encounter will make it go smoother as you can understand the mechanics of the enemies since you will be playing them.</p>
                        <p>So, when I’m going to be running a campaign, I will either think of a generic concept, or get a pre-build module to start from and then start thinking about a campaign.  I find that it’s always a good idea to make some of the initial encounters for a new party to be skill based so that everyone can learn what the others are capable of.  I try to give each player a job skill so a player can say that I’m trained as a scout (instead of just saying that he’s a thief).</p>
                        <p>Once the PCs have a general idea of who can do what, you can throw them into a combat situation, but it needs to be scaled way down.  You never want to intentionally kill a PC in their initial combat (not that I haven’t done that in the past), but it should be frowned upon.  I typically follow the following rules:</p>
                        <p><b>Boss Fight:</b> # of party members x their average level (so 4 PC’s at 1st level would be a 4th level boss)</p>
                        <p><b>Lieutenant Fights:</b> ½ the party members x their average level (4 PC’s at 1st would be a 2nd lvl Lt.)</p>
                        <p><b>Minion fights:</b> typical monsters at the party’s level</p>
                        <p><b>Initial combat:</b> 1/8th party level in enemies.</p>
                        <p>This can lead up to other combats that are up to ½ of the party’s levels in enemies.  These are the typical trash / random encounters and are really just there to deplete the party’s resources and give them some cheap experience. Once you’re able to have some sort of idea of scaling, then come up with a group of enemies to fight (like orcs / goblins / humans/ etc) and what the general premise of why they will be fighting them.  Like I said, if I’m out of ideas, I will take a pre-generated module to give me a rough outline, then build from there.</p>
                        <p>Once I have that figured out, I would then build a few example PCs and throw them into combat and see if I’ve overpowered it or not.  50 Orc minions + a boss might be a bit much for a group of 4-5 4th level PCs, but you’ll need to try a few things, then be able to adjust as the PCs actually encounter the situation.  If the group isn’t doing well, maybe having some of the monsters fail a morale check and flee, if the PC’s are wiping the monsters with little effort, you increase the danger or add more enemies that come from around the corner, etc.</p>
                        <p>Taking all of these things into account, you then start to flesh out your campaign corner of the world.  Go to a treasure builder and figure out what all they have.  Don’t just give out gold pieces and magic items.  Most monsters will have captured trading caravans and have a lot of that gold tied up in trade items like bolts of cloth/silk, lumber, iron ingots, normal weapons, etc.</p>
                        <p>Now that you have some of that worked out, build a fort / cave system / home base for your monsters and place guards and scouts appropriately.  Build traps to foil the PCs.  Have the area make sense.  Once I have some of this stuff in place, I will think about it in my head for a day or so, running through various scenarios that I think the PCs will do, but not overthink it as a typical PC group will tend to do the unexpected and ruin all of your world building.</p>
                        <p>90% of the worldbuilding is for you.  The PC’s will only discover/interact with about 10%.  Too bad for them.  You had fun building it for them to enjoy and they enjoyed the 10% that they interacted with.</p>
